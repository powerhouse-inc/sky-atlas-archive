# Sky Atlas Archive

This repository contains snapshots of the Sky Atlas. 

The most recent json file of the data is available at `atlas-tree.json`. A simplified form of this file is also available at `atlas-tree-simple.txt`. The simplified version strips out metadata and renders to a plain text file.

The history of this repository shows the changes made to the atlas over time. For completeness though, we also save a new snapshot of the data with a timestamp every time the data is refreshed. Along with these snapshots, we provide a `.diff` file with the changes for quickly comparing changes.
