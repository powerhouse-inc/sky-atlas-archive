~~~A.0.1.1.4 - Universal Alignment - core
~~~content:
~~~Universal Alignment refers to an actor's holistic understanding of their connection to their environment or context. This enables them to anticipate how their actions influence everything around them, including the second-order effects that impact them in return. This holistic understanding is rooted in the context of human morality, values, and the natural world. An actor who is universally aligned can grasp the intent behind universally aligned rules and identify discrepancies between the technical incentives of rules and their universal purpose. An action that is in opposition to Universal Alignment constitutes misalignment. Preventing misalignment is the fundamental objective of Alignment Engineering and Alignment Artifacts.

~~~content:
~~~Universal Alignment is a spectrum, and actors are more or less Universally Aligned.

In theory, Universal Alignment is absolute, but in practice it cannot be measured deterministically and thus practically will always be subject to debate and changes over time. Alignment Engineering aims to minimize the degree that actors experience their own, and others’, Universal Alignment changing over time.

The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the outcomes of Alignment Engineering - namely, the Alignment Artifacts or rules themselves - always have the spirit, or underlying intent, to serve human values and promote the public good within a specific context.

~~~A.0.1.1.6 - Alignment Artifact Strength - core
~~~content:
~~~The strength of an Alignment Artifact dictates the minimum level of Universal Alignment that an actor must possess in order to take actions that are universally aligned when interacting with the Artifact.

Alignment Artifact Strength is enhanced by ensuring that Ecosystem Intelligence evolves such that each actor’s self-interested incentives correspond as precisely as possible with requirements of Universal Alignment. This alignment minimizes the additional effort, or “inner incentive”, that an actor must exert to overcome misalignment.

The stronger an Alignment Artifact, the less inner incentive that an actor need possess to take actions that are universally aligned.

~~~A.0.1.1.9 - Letter Of The Rule Vs Spirit Of The Rule - core
~~~content:
~~~The distinction between the “letter of the rule” and the “spirit of the rule” refers to whether an individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. 
The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context.


A “letter of the rule” interpretation adheres strictly to the rule’s language, often exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule’s exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if it benefits the interpreter.

A “spirit of the rule” interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule’s true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule’s language, this approach appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.

Example:

Imagine a large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn’t regulated as a greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.

By exploiting the “letter of the rule,” the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment and public health in practice.

A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their “spirit” or underlying purpose — protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts the regulations’ intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.

~~~A.0.1.1.12 - Slippery Slope Misalignment - core
~~~content:
~~~Slippery Slope Misalignment is the shortest path to misalignment where incremental misaligned acts are justified in various ways. These can include ignoring the potential significance and larger impact of acts due to their small scale; the trivial way that misalignment occurs; the good intentions of the actor; or the conviction that the ends justifies the means.

Understanding Slippery Slope Misalignment means understanding that any misalignment at all is always very serious and, if not dealt with, results in increased risk of disequilibrium and alignment failure. In the context of a decentralized ecosystem such as Sky, this could mean a governance attack or financial collapse.

~~~A.0.1.1.15 - Scope Alignment Artifact (Scope Artifact) - core
~~~content:
~~~A Scope Artifact is an Alignment Artifact designed to align the actions and incentives of participants within a specific Scope defined by the Atlas. It provides a framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and governance within the defined Scope.

Each Scope has its own unique set of challenges and objectives that require a tailored approach to alignment.

The strength of a Scope Alignment Artifact depends on how well it aligns with Universal Alignment principles, as well as how effectively it is communicated and understood by participants within the defined Scope. A strong Scope Artifact can help prevent misalignment and ensure that all participants are working towards a common goal for the benefit of the entire ecosystem.

Scope Artifacts must not be changed beyond the Scope boundaries defined by the Atlas; this constitutes Slippery Slope Misalignment.

~~~The Atlas is the foundational set of rules powering Sky Ecosystem. It consists of Immutable Documents and Adaptive Documents. The former enshrine the Spirit of the Atlas and become permanently immutable from the moment the Sky Ecosystem enters the Endgame State. The Adaptive Documents practically operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas and will be continuously improved through the Sky Governance process. The Immutable part of the Atlas ensures the aligned evolution of Sky: it mitigates the potential and actual damage caused by Slippery Slope Misalignment, which erodes the potency of Alignment Engineering over time.

~~~content:
~~~Incentive Slack refers to the discrepancy between the explicit incentives (those clearly defined and communicated) and the implicit incentives (those inferred by actors) within an Aligned Structure. Incentive Slack can arise when coded rules are either not enforced or are too restrictive or impractical, leading to a pattern of bypassing these rules. When Incentive Slack is high, it creates the perception that rules are likely to be ignored, without regard for the spirit of the rules. This results in a significant risk of widespread misalignment. Incentive Slack cannot occur in an Aligned Structure in which actors are universally aligned and actively enforcing the rules.

Because there’s a penalty for exiting, Sealing helps generate additional skin in the game and increases long-term alignment among ecosystem participants.

~~~content:
~~~Agents are first-class economic citizens of Sky that autonomously pursue business opportunities. Each Agent has its own Agent Artifact and token. Initially, the creation of an Agent results in a Proto-Agent, which lacks any specialized role. To gain functionality within the Sky ecosystem, a Proto-Agent must deploy a special Transformation Primitive to transform into a specific Agent sub-type. The Agent sub-types currently defined in the Atlas include 1) Star Agent and 2) Executor Agent, with the Executor Agent sub-type further divided into Operational Executor Agents and Core Executor Agents.

Although Executor Agents are not yet operational, the Atlas nonetheless defines the foundational rules, processes, and governance structures necessary for their eventual activation. In the medium to long term, these Executor Agents will become fully operative and perform an essential function in facilitating the activities of Star Agents across the Sky ecosystem.

~~~Star Agents maintain and automate Sky features in new markets, and innovate custom products. Star Agents are the only Agent type that can access all Sky Primitives; whereas Executor Agents are limited in the Primitives they can access.

• Star Agents cannot directly operationalize those elements of their strategies that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem infrastructure. For such protocol-level and ecosystem-critical operations, Star Agents must rely on Operational Executor Agents for implementation.

• When a Star Agent formulates a new initiative, it encodes the relevant instructions and parameters into its Agent Artifact. Insofar as the Star Agent’s Artifact requires protocol-level interactions, the Operational Executors use the Artifact as a detailed operational blueprint for implementing the Star Agent’s directives—ensuring consistency with the Atlas and minimizing risk.

• This ensures a robust division between Star Agents’ strategic, externally facing activities and the specialized operational activities that directly interface with Sky’s core systems.

~~~content:
~~~Executor Agents (”Executors”) are specialized Agents that implement those elements of a Star Agent’s activities that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem resources, leaving Star Agents free to focus on strategic, business development, and marketing efforts. There are two Executor sub-types: Core Executor Agents (”Core Executors”) and Operational Executor Agents (”Operational Executors”).

• Operational Executor Agents handle the day-to-day execution of those portions of a Star Agent’s strategies that directly interface with the Sky Protocol, strictly following the instructions laid out in each Star Agent’s Artifact. Star Agents cannot be active in the Sky Ecosystem unless they have an active “Operational Executor Accord” which codifies their relationship with an Operational Executor. Operational Executors take on the risk of Star Agents’ outcomes by providing collateralized insurance against losses or liabilities. Operational Executor Agents’ Operational Collateral can also cover losses from negligence or malicious behavior by the Operational Executor in carrying out the Star Agent’s strategy.

• Core Executors, on the other hand, oversee the activities of Operational Executors, ensuring that the implementation of Star Agent strategies aligns with the Atlas.

• By separating strategy from operations, this division of labor empowers Star Agents to innovate rapidly and expand their ventures without needing to develop specialized operational expertise, as Operational Executors manage the day-to-day technical implementation under Core Executor oversight.

~~~Operational Executor Agents (”Operational Executors”) are specialized Executor Agents tasked with implementing and verifying those elements of a Star Agent’s strategy that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem resources. While Star Agents autonomously set strategic direction, Operational Executors are responsible for operationalizing those activities that modify on-chain or protocol-level state, relying on the relevant Primitive Configuration Documents in the Agent Artifact.

Each Operational Executor Agent must comprise at least one Facilitator and at least one GovOps actor. Facilitators are responsible for interpreting the Atlas and the Agent Artifact and instructing GovOps actors to carry out the corresponding actions. To ensure accountability and mitigate potential risks, Operational Executor Agents must maintain Operational Collateral, which serves as a guarantee to cover losses or damages resulting from negligence or malicious behavior by either Facilitators or GovOps actors.

~~~A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity - core
~~~content:
~~~The next-generation Atlas is a self-contained governance infrastructure powering the Sky Ecosystem. It is designed to grow in tandem with the adaptive intelligence of the Ecosystem. Yet these first iterations of the next-generation Atlas may not sufficiently account for the critical, unforeseen contingencies that can arise, particularly as the Protocol is in a dynamic period of evolution. 

To ensure the Ecosystem grows in resilience and advances toward the Endgame State, it must be able to respond quickly to pressing changes in its environment. To facilitate this, the Scope Facilitators are granted broad discretionary power, given their close proximity to, and knowledge of, the Sky Ecosystem. 

Where the Atlas does not provide clear guidance on a current challenge, Scope Facilitators are empowered to infer the Spirit of the Atlas in such a way as to maximize Universal Alignment and secure the Ecosystem’s growth, security and progression toward the Endgame State. 

Scope Facilitators also have the discretion to supersede existing Atlas provisions where they determine the latter to be unsuitable for current challenges. 

The discretionary power granted herein is temporary.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~If a Scope Facilitator decides to supersede a particular Atlas document due to its inadequacy in addressing a specific challenge, the Facilitator is encouraged, though not required, to initiate a Governance Poll to allow SKY holders to vote on a revised version of the document that corrects the identified shortcomings. The Target Document does not require Facilitators to run a Governance Poll to formalize their actions.

Similarly, if a Facilitator identifies a gap in the Atlas where a particular need is not explicitly addressed, they may extrapolate a course of action based on their interpretation of the Spirit of the Atlas. In this case, as well, the Target Document does not require Facilitators to run a Governance Poll to formalize their interpretation or extrapolated actions.

This Action Tenet acknowledges the necessity for Facilitators to possess flexible and broad discretionary authority during the early stages of the Atlas’  development. Such flexibility ensures that the ecosystem can swiftly adapt to emerging challenges. Consequently, it is important at this stage to avoid over-formalizing actions and decisions taken by Facilitators pursuant to

~Atlas Documents are essential to the structure and governance of the Sky Ecosystem. They are organized into document trees, which include Immutable Documents and Adaptive Documents. Immutable Documents embody the Spirit of the Atlas; while Adaptive Documents operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas and facilitate its aligned evolution. This Article defines the properties, development, and procedures associated with Atlas Documents.

~~A.1.2.1 - Definition And Properties Of Atlas Documents - section
~~content:
~~Atlas Documents are the basic building blocks for structuring data in the Atlas. They are organized as nested document trees, each with a unique Document Identifier. 

The first three layers contain the Immutable Documents, which together enshrine the Spirit of the Atlas and the core, permanent boundaries for how to operationalize it without risking slippery slope misalignment. 

In the layers below the Immutable Documents are the Adaptive Documents, which are continuously improved through the Sky Governance process. The Adaptive Documents interpret and practically operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas within the boundaries set by the Immutable Documents.

~~~A.1.2.1.1 - Document Identifiers - core
~~~content:
~~~All Atlas Documents are distinguishable through their unique Document Identifier. The Document Identifier is the technical name of the Atlas Document, and it determines its position in the Document Tree of the Atlas. All Document Identifiers begin with a capital A, and the numbers and letters of the Document Identifiers are separated with dots, with each dot signifying that the Atlas Document is one layer deeper in the tree structure. The Document Identifiers help determine the position of each Atlas Document, and makes it easier to estimate the relationship between two different Atlas Documents.

~~~~content:
~~~~The Name property is assigned to each Atlas Document to provide a human-readable name, making it easier for humans to identify the document and understand its purpose and function at a glance. This Name serves as an abstracted overview of the document's content, distinguishing it from other documents in a user-friendly manner.

However, for data management and record-keeping purposes, the official designation of an Atlas Document is its unique Document Identifier. As a result, the Name property can be modified with no substantive consequences.

~~~~A.1.2.1.2.2 - Version Property - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The Version property of Atlas Documents specifies how many times it has been modified. Every time an Atlas Document is modified, the newly modified Document gets its version number incremented, and the old version is recorded as a historical version with a Document Identifier equivalent to its version number. 

As an example, if an Atlas Document located at 1.1.1 with version number 3 is modified, the new Atlas Document will have version number 4, and the old Atlas Document will be located at 1.1.1.v3. 

This ensures all historical versions of Atlas documents are retained permanently as a part of the Atlas.

An Atlas Document with Components must always have all of its components properly filled according to the requirements defined by its Type Specification. Some documents have custom logic for how their Components behave, and this custom logic is specified through a special reserved component property called 'Custom'. Atlas Documents of Types with specified custom logic components can have variable number of components, and different characteristics of each component, for each instance of the Type. Custom components are always appended to the end of the list of components.

~~~The Atlas Document Types can be broadly categorized into distinct groups that determine how they are modified and how they function in the Atlas. At the highest level there are the Immutable Documents and the Adaptive Documents. The Adaptive Documents are further subdivided into three (3) distinct groups: Primary Documents, Supporting Documents, and Accessory Documents. The category of an Atlas Document can be inferred from its Document Identifier, as each group has unique and non-overlapping rules for validity of their Document Identifiers.

~~~~Immutable Documents are the most important part of the Atlas: they record the Spirit of the Atlas, detailing the vision, purpose and unalienable principles of Sky. In the transition to Endgame State, Immutable documents remain modifiable by the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. Once the Endgame State has been reached, however, Immutable Documents become fully immutable, i.e., they can never be changed. Immutable Documents have Document identifiers that are at most three (3) layers deep in the Document Tree.

~~~~content:
~~~~Primary Documents are the cornerstone of the Adaptive Documents and ensure the practical operationalization and resilience of the Atlas. They detail specific, practical principles, rules, processes and roles necessary to operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas. In the transition to Endgame, Primary Documents can be modified with no restrictions, using the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. Once the Endgame State is reached, Primary Documents generally must be modified as slowly as possible, and as little as possible while remaining fully adapted to the external environment. Primary Documents have Document Identifiers that are 4 layers or deeper in the Document Tree, and cannot contain 0's.

~~~~Supporting Documents are attached to Immutable Documents and Primary Documents (called their “Target Document”). They provide context and in some cases advanced functionality to the Target Documents, enabling them to be fully operationally effective and unambiguous. 

The different Types of Supporting Documents have different functions. Some Supporting Document types are required for all Immutable Documents and Primary Documents; while others are only required for certain Primary Document Types. 

Most Supporting Document types can be freely modified through the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. The Active Data Supporting Document type can be modified in real time by processes outside of said governance processes. 

Supporting Documents always have Document Identifiers that contain at least one 0.

Article Documents are immutable, foundational parts of the Atlas and their content must be considered when interpreting all principles, rules and processes of Atlas Documents nested below them.
Immutable Document
Article
The Article Type is used for the second layer documents nested below the six Scope documents of the Atlas. They directly describe individual focus areas that together fully cover everything needed for the purpose of the Scope to be fulfilled.

“Content": The content Component is very flexible and provides in-depth human-readable language to elaborate on the specific principles, rules, and processes that operationalize the Section’s parent Article.
Section Documents have Document Identifiers one layer below the Article Documents.
Section Documents are immutable parts of the Atlas and their content must be considered when interpreting all principles, rules and processes of Adaptive Documents nested below them.
Immutable Document
Section
The Section Type is used for the third layer of Immutable Documents nested under the Articles of each Scope in the Atlas. Section Documents provide additional structure and specification to the principles, rules and processes within the focus area of the Article. The Section Type acts as a foundation and boundary against misalignment of the Adaptive Documents that are nested below it. Generally, Section Documents should be “atomized”, or restricted to specifying only a single discrete unit of logic.

Original Context Data Documents must always be located at the .0.1 position of their Target Document, or nested in a subtree of Original Context Data Documents below the .0.1 position.
The Original Context Data Document should be in a finished form alongside the creation or modification of its Target Document, as it aims to capture the original context and intention of the contents of the Target Document. However, it can and should be modified if new evidence and data comes to light that helps to better describe the original context and intention of the Target Document, or if new perspectives or new external events makes it possible and useful to modify the Original Context Data Document in a way that doesn’t contradict its earlier language.
Supporting Document
Original Context Data
Original Context Data Documents explain the intention and reasoning behind the content of its Target Document, to make interpretation and extrapolation of its contents easier, and provide additional information to other forms of analysis. Original Context Data helps anchor the fundamental purpose and meaning of the target document to its original context, and should help mitigate cultural drift over time. Original Context Data can contain unstructured data used for genesis data integration of early Atlas Documents. Original Context Data Documents can form nested subtrees to organize their data if relevant.

~~~~content:
~~~~[See below]
"Content": The Tenet Component specifies the adjudication logic, principle or doctrine that is directly derived from the Target Document. This Component can include policy statements underpinning the adjudication principle. Such policy statements can highlight the values that are served by, or the benefits gained from, adhering to the Tenet. When facing edge cases, these policy statements can help Facilitators to extrapolate from the Tenet's logic to achieve the most suitable outcome.
Facilitator Action Tenet Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Facilitator Action Tenet Directory Document (which latter is located at position .0.4) of their Target Document. Action Tenet documents are located at the .0.4.X position, with X being the incremented number. 
Facilitator Action Tenet Documents are likely to be necessary supplements for interpreting the Immutable Document types, as these tend to have generalized, broad language. The Core Document type has the function of operationalizing the Immutable Documents, and thus its language will tend to be far more specific and concrete. For that reason, Action Tenet Supporting Documents may not be necessary for a particular Core Document. This is not a hard-coded rule, however. The determination of whether an Action Tenet Document is needed for any given Atlas document should always be tailor-made.

Action Tenet Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of governance principles and rules. The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other Supporting Documents of the Target Document.

If the Action Tenet can be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, that term is listed first; followed by a hyphen; and then, an abstract of the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Organizational Drift - ACs' Mandate When Instigating Action Can Be Traced Back to a Discrete Entity". If the Action Tenet cannot be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, the "Name" property should simply summarize the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Evaluating AC breach of role-specific requirement vs. general requirement”.
Supporting Document
Facilitator Action Tenet
The Facilitator Action Tenet Type is used to provide concrete adjudication principles derived from its Target Document. It distills the governance logic of the Target Document into a concise principle to guide Facilitators in resolving disputes related to the Target Document. The practical application of the Tenet is demonstrated by its "Scenario" Subdocuments.

Facilitator Scenario Variation 
Facilitator Scenario Variation Documents are variations on the hypothetical fact patterns presented in their parent Scenario document (”original Scenario”). Each Variation substitutes elements of its original Scenario to demonstrate whether and why the finding of Aligned/Misaligned would change. 

Like the Scenario Type, Scenario Variations are also designed to illustrate the practical application of a single Facilitator Action Tenet, i.e., the Scenario’s parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document. 

Scenario Variations are classified as either Aligned or Misaligned. Aligned Scenarios conform to the logic of the Target Document. Misaligned Scenarios have breached the Target Document logic and are thus in violation of the Atlas.

~~~~content:
~~~~[See below]
"Research Prompt": This component contains descriptions of potential problems, unanswered questions or other concerns associated with the Target Document. 
Unlike other Supporting Documents, the document identifier of Needed Research documents is not derived from the Supporting Root of their Target Document. The “standalone” numbering scheme of Needed Research documents enables them to be linked to more than one Atlas Document, no matter the latter’s location in the Atlas document tree. Needed Research Document Identifiers begin with the prefix “NR-”,  followed by an incremented number.  
Generally, Needed Research Documents are most effective when linked to Primary Documents or Supporting Documents. These Document types have the objective of extrapolating from the abstract logic of their Parent documents to formulate rules and processes that are more concrete and actionable. Therefore, inputs for Needed Research are more appropriately sourced at this deeper level in the Atlas Document tree. 
Supporting Document
Needed Research
Needed Research Documents specify potential problems associated with their Target Document. Such problems can include potential gaps or conflicts in logic; questions regarding the operation of the Target Document to which there are currently no answers; etc.

As such, Needed Research documents formalize continuing research into Universal Alignment and enable the adaptive intelligence of the ecosystem to drive the evolution of Sky. Scope Facilitators, Atlas workstream contributors or other ecosystem participants are able to submit Needed Research inputs, which are then progressively processed through the standardized Atlas data integration protocol.

The gradual processing of Needed Research inputs can lead to modifications to the organization or content of Atlas documents, as well as concrete process improvements and new initiatives.

~~~~content:
~~~~Generally, when an AC acts to impact governance in any way, they must do so according to rules/principles/processes that are based on the explicit language of the Immutable Documents. Because of the nature of language and the fact that the Atlas can never anticipate all possible scenarios, it will sometimes be necessary for the basis of ACs' actions to be sourced from extrapolations or inferences of logic, but these must be grounded.

'Grounded inferences' means that derivations, deductions or extensions of governance logic maintain a strong, clear connection and alignment with the delineated processes and frameworks explicitly defined in the Immutable Documents.

Because ungrounded inferences of logic lack such a robust and clearly documented foundation, they introduce severe misalignment risk given the potential for intentional misrepresentation or distortion. The interpreter may deviate from the genuine intent of the Immutable Documents, not driven by an earnest effort to understand but rather influenced by personal motives or ulterior agendas.

Inference or extrapolation is necessarily inherent in interpretation, and comes in degrees. In the context of the Target Document, the element, “clearly delineated processes and frameworks,” affirms that an interpreter's extraction of rules/principles/processes should be maximally grounded in the explicit language of the Immutable Documents.

~~~~A.1.4.4 - Highest Standard - Facilitators must apply strictest possible requirements of Universal Alignment on ACs - tenet
~~~~content:
~~~~In any adjudication involving potential misalignment of Alignment Conservers (ACs), Facilitators are unequivocally directed to apply the strictest and highest standards of Universal Alignment.

As ACs are held to the most rigorous standards of Universal Alignment, Facilitators should acknowledge evidence of misalignment if such evidence is deemed at least 51% more likely than not to be valid or to substantiate the presented claim. Additionally, should the overall weight of the evidence demonstrate a 51% or greater chance that the AC committed a misaligned act, the Facilitator is required to derecognize the AC.

Given the exceptionally high stakes in cases of potential AC misalignment, Facilitators must prioritize an approach grounded in an abundance of caution, steering away from notions of 'fairness' or 'lenience.' Any lapse or misjudgment on the part of an AC cannot be excused based on ignorance of the rules, good intentions, honest mistake or similar factors. Maximal accountability for ACs is non-negotiable, a principle underpinned by the indispensable role of ACs as stewards of Universal Alignment.

~~~~A.1.4.4 - Systematic basis of adjudication, fact-finding and evidence - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc. 

The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. 

Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence?  What types of evidence are permissible to consider? See 
A.1.5.17 - Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically
. What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? 

Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. 

How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element “the highest standard of Universal Alignment”? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

~~~~content:
~~~~Whether an entity is "operationally active" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. As long as an entity occupies or assumes a role that is formally defined in the Atlas, that entity is "operationally active" in that role. This is notwithstanding the amount of time the entity devotes to a role; the nature of the work performed by the entity in a role; the fact that the entity is on a leave of absence from one role; the fact that the entity's role is uncompensated; or the fact that the entity alternates between two roles to avoid simultaneous performance of both roles.

This Tenet is based on the rationale of protecting against misalignment risks that arise when a stakeholder occupies two or more ecosystem roles, each of which has different mandates and inner incentives. Such misalignment risks include conflict of interest and bias, collusion and conspiracy.

An unranked, uncompensated Aligned Delegate is nevertheless an 'ecosystem role' in the sense of the Target Document. Notwithstanding being unranked and uncompensated, the AD role still carries with it a mandate and array of incentives that are distinct from those of a Facilitator.

At the time their behavior was discovered by another Facilitator, the Entity had been performing solely in the role of a Stability Scope Advisor, while remaining on a leave of absence from their Facilitator role.
Misaligned
If an actor assumes more than one role in the Sky ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises. That the Entity was on a leave of absence from one role does not negate this risk. A contributor on an extended leave of absence has not formally cut ties with the role. Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates, incentives and access/permissions. It is conceivable that Entity's Stability Scope Advisor work could be compromised or influenced, even in subtle ways, by the experiences, knowledge and biases to which Entity is exposed as a Facilitator. Therefore, the risk of misalignment, which the Target Document aims to guard against, remains present.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity from the Facilitator role per 
A.1.4.10 - AC Derecognition
.

The Facilitator should likely consider derecognizing Entity from the Stability Scope Advisor role. No specific logic exists as yet for the adjudication of misalignment on the part of a Scope Advisor.

Entity claims it has never been on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus, Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles.
Misaligned
If an actor assumes more than one role in the Sky ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises. That the Entity's second position is in an "on-call" or stand-by position does not negate this risk. Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates, incentives and access/permissions. It is conceivable that Entity's decisionmaking in their first role could be compromised or influenced, even in subtle ways, by the experiences, knowledge and biases to which Entity is exposed in their second role. Therefore, the risk of misalignment, which the Target Document aims to guard against, remains present.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity as an AD per 
A.1.4.10 - AC Derecognition
.

No specific logic exists as yet for the adjudication of misalignment on the part of an Ecosystem Actor team member.

Entity claims it has never been on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus, Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles. During its investigation, the Facilitator discovered evidence that, despite the EA having a general policy that "on call" devs are paid only a nominal fee for the bounded time periods they are on call, Entity had been receiving an inordinately large compensation from the EA. When the Facilitator pressed both the EA and Entity for an explanation, none was given.
Misaligned as to Entity.
In contrast to the original Scenario, the Facilitator uncovered evidence that indicates Entity was not, as claimed, a mere "on call" dev, but rather was engaged in substantive work to justify the large compensation amount. 

That the Facilitator was stonewalled in its investigation also is a strong indication of malign intent on the part of Entity and the EA. Yet, there is no concrete proof of this. 

Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to extrapolate that derecognition from the AC role would suffice, per 
A.1.4.10 - AC Derecognition
.

The concern remains that, potentially, a bad actor can continue to exploit the ecosystem, especially if other ecosystem participants are not aware of their questionable history. To mitigate this risk, the Facilitator can include details about the evidence it discovered in its formal derecognition notice, which can impact the reputation score of Entity.

~~~~~Entity was a full-time team member of a Governance Facilitator. Entity emailed the Facilitator a formal letter of resignation and then transitioned into the role of an AD. The Facilitator did not receive the resignation email and continued to list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Governance Facilitator’s investigation, Entity provided proof of the resignation email. The email clearly stated an effective date of resignation, which date was prior to Entity's transition into the AD role. Entity also provided proof that all their permissions to the Facilitator team workspace were revoked; and they had no further communications or interactions with the Facilitator team after their intended resignation date.
Aligned
Though the Facilitator incorrectly continued to list Entity as a team member, in actual practice, Entity had cut all ties with the Facilitator team after the intended resignation date. This was proven via the dated resignation email; the revoked permissions; and the lack of communications. Given these facts, the Target Document is not triggered.

The Facilitator did not receive any resignation notice from Entity and continued to list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Governance Facilitor's investigation, Entity claimed it had sent the Facilitator a resignation email, but could not provide actual proof of this. The Governance Facilitator also discovered that Entity still had permissions to the Facilitator team workspace. The team's Discord contained casual, non-work related interactions between Entity and the Facilitator team members even after the date Entity became a formally recognized AD.
Misaligned
Entity was unable to provide any proof that it had formally resigned its first role with the Facilitator team. Merely claiming that a resignation email was sent is not sufficient. Further, unlike the original Scenario, Entity in this Variation continued to have access to the Facilitator team workspace even after the alleged date of resignation. Technically speaking, Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates and incentives. The potential exists for conflict of interest, collusion, etc. The part-time role does not impact this analysis.

~~~~The Target Document is violated if an Alignment Conserver formally occupies two or more Sky ecosystem roles. The phrase "other ecosystem roles" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a function in the Sky ecosystem.

The rationale of this rule is to protect against misalignment risks that arise when a stakeholder occupies two or more ecosystem roles, each of which has different mandates and inner incentives. Such misalignment risks include conflict of interest and bias, collusion and conspiracy.

One argument against this would be that quality contributors are a scarce resource. Further, the decentralized work paradigm encourages having several part-time jobs. 

The sharing of contributors across several Sky teams  - such that contributors gain experience in multiple operational aspects - might arguably enhance ecosystem intelligence. 

Would it make a meaningful difference to require contributors who do wish to work multiple roles to be doxxed?

~~~~~~A.1.4.9.2.1 - Adjudication Guidelines to be applied to a second misaligned act or a first misaligned act that is not mild - tenet
~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.

Despite the lack of explicit guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in 
A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers
 to reach a reliable adjudication principle. 

Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk. The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an opportunity for corrective action and learning. 

After the initial warning, any subsequent breach must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal Alignment.

~~~~~~The element “mild slippery slope breach” characterizes a form of misalignment or rule breach that, when viewed in isolation, exhibits relatively insignificant scope or impact. Furthermore, a “very mild” act of misalignment often indicates a lack of ill intent (i.e., innocent mistake) or premeditation on the part of the rule violator. A “very mild slippery slope breach” will likely be the violator's first offense.

~~~~~~What specific criteria or actions qualify as "severe" enough to warrant derecognition? Develop clear guidelines that define what constitutes a "severe case" in the context of misaligned actions. This involves identifying key indicators of severity, such as the magnitude of the impact, the intent behind the actions, and the potential or actual harm caused.

Also needed: What actions or behaviors specifically constitute a "Governance Attack”? Can you propose criteria or frameworks for assessing intent, the scope of actions, and their potential consequences? The research can perhaps explore how different governance models define and respond to attacks and consider psychological, legal, and operational perspectives to support a more fact-driven interpretive approach.

~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~The element “governance attack” is a critical violation of the Sky ecosystem's governance protocols, far surpassing minor breaches in scope and impact. This term is reserved for misaligned acts with the near-term potential to severely compromise the Ecosystem's foundational structure and operational integrity. In contrast to mild breaches, which may involve actors with unintentional or benign motivations, a Governance Attack is distinguished by its deliberate and premeditated nature. Actors orchestrating such attacks are likely driven by strategic intent, aiming to destabilize or exploit the governance framework for their own gain.

~~~~A.1.4.9 - Systematic basis of adjudication, fact-finding and evidence - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc. 

The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. 

Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence?  What types of evidence are permissible to consider? See 
A.1.5.17 - Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically
. What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? 

Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. 

How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element “the highest standard of Universal Alignment”? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

~~~~A.1.4.10 - Derecognition Uncertainty Due To Anonymous Actors - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~The Target Document defines the act of derecognition as “permanently removing” an entity from the Alignment Conserver role. In fact, it is not possible to effect such a permanent removal. Given the presence of anonymous/pseudonymous actors in the decentralized “workforce” of the Sky ecosystem, a known identity of an actor can be barred from an AC role; and yet that actor can easily re-enter the system under a different pseudonym or identity. Consider what measures can be implemented to counteract the scenario where derecognized entities reappear under a different guise. A robust reputation system is already planned; by tracking reputation that is earned over a long timescale, a derecognized entity would be barred from quickly regaining a foothold.

~~~~~The first message must be cryptographically signed by the applicant’s Ethereum address controlling the deployed Delegate Contract(s). The cryptographically signed message demonstrates that the applicant controls the Ethereum address that, in turn, controls their deployed Delegate Contract(s).

This first message must include the following elements to be valid:

1. A title of “Aligned Delegate Recognition - Delegate Contract”, and

2. A timestamp recording the time and date that the message was cryptographically signed.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~A simple way to provide the required cryptographically signed messages is to use the Verified Signature on-chain mechanism hosted by Etherscan (
https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures
). The cryptographic verification comes from the prospective Aligned Delegate “signing” or validating the messages using their chosen Ethereum address. In addition, the cryptographically signed messages should contain the required elements (titles and timestamps) to be valid. The required elements are specified in the Target Document.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~The element “responsibly provided” in the Target Documents means that whistleblower evidence must have been secured ethically, i.e., publicly available blockchain data. This generally means, no hacking or unauthorized access to systems, or breaches of data protection laws. 

Do challenging gray areas remain? What sort of standards or criteria should be met by whistleblower evidence to be considered responsibly gathered? 

For instance, is evidence gathered from private communication channels considered responsibly obtained if it was leaked to the whistleblower by an insider? How do we handle situations where the evidence is obtained through methods that might be legal but are still ethically questionable? 

And what sort of standards/criteria should be met by whistleblower evidence to be credible and useful in an investigation? 

How to assess the credibility or probative value of evidence, especially when dealing with blockchain data, which can be complex and difficult to interpret? What standards of proof should be required for evidence to be considered credible, particularly in cases where the evidence is circumstantial rather than direct? Perhaps this is already answered by current logic that demands that Facilitators apply the highest standards of Universal Alignment to AC adjudications, without affording benefit of the doubt.

What are the expectations placed on Facilitators to verify whistleblower evidence?

~~~~For the purpose of enforcing the Target Document, should there be explicit criteria for Aligned Delegates’ voting-communications? What constitutes an adequate explanation for each vote? How would Governance Facilitators evaluate ADs’ explanations for quality, completeness, etc.? How can Governance Facilitators objectively assess explanations that may vary widely in style and content?

How might ADs’ explanations vary across different types of votes, and should the criteria reflect these differences? Should more complex or high-stakes votes require more detailed explanations than routine or procedural votes?

What feedback mechanisms should be in place to help ADs improve their explanations?

What are the risks of not having explicit criteria for voting-communications? One is the potential failure of the Target Document’s objective to ensure that ADs’ voting activity is transparent to SKY holders who have delegated to that AD.

~~~A.1.5.16 - Swift Action Is Required From Facilitators To Redress AD Misalignment - section
~~~content:
~~~The Facilitators must act swiftly when an AD is suspected of breaching the requirements defined in this Article, or the requirements defined in 
A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers
.

Any Scope Facilitator has the authority to formally raise an allegation of AD misalignment with the Governance Facilitators, which then obligates the latter to initiate a formal adjudication pursuant to 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
.

A Facilitator's failure to act promptly in addressing credible evidence of AD misalignment or to mitigate the risk of misalignment spreading among ADs is considered an act of misalignment itself. Formal allegations of such failure must be adjudicated by the Governance Facilitators pursuant to the same process referenced in the above-cited document.

~~~~Any community member or Aligned Delegate with information pertinent to suspected Alignment Conserver misalignment may take their concerns directly to the Governance Facilitators.  Upon receiving such information, the Governance Facilitators must promptly conduct an initial review to quickly assess the credibility of the concern.

~~~~The element “responsibly provided” in the Target Documents means that whistleblower evidence must have been secured ethically, i.e., publicly available blockchain data. This generally means, no hacking or unauthorized access to systems, or breaches of data protection laws. 

Do challenging gray areas remain? What sort of standards or criteria should be met by whistleblower evidence to be considered responsibly gathered? 

For instance, is evidence gathered from private communication channels considered responsibly obtained if it was leaked to the whistleblower by an insider? How do we handle situations where the evidence is obtained through methods that might be legal but are still ethically questionable? 

And what sort of standards/criteria should be met by whistleblower evidence to be credible and useful in an investigation? 

How to assess the credibility or probative value of evidence, especially when dealing with blockchain data, which can be complex and difficult to interpret? What standards of proof should be required for evidence to be considered credible, particularly in cases where the evidence is circumstantial rather than direct? Perhaps this is already answered by current logic that demands that Facilitators apply the highest standards of Universal Alignment to AC adjudications, without affording benefit of the doubt.

What are the expectations placed on Facilitators to verify whistleblower evidence?

~~~~A.1.5.17 - Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically - tenet
~~~~content:
~~~~The phrase “responsibly provided” places limits on the sort of data, evidence and information that will enable a whistleblower to qualify for the bounty. Such data, evidence or information must have been secured ethically. A whistleblower who used publicly available data (e.g., public Discord or Forum posts) to demonstrate that an Aligned Delegate committed misaligned acts will qualify for the bounty. A whistleblower who hacked into the Aligned Delegate’s devices or accounts to make this same demonstration will be disqualified from receiving the bounty. 

Where reasonable people would disagree about the ethical nature of the whistleblower’s actions, the Governance Facilitators should err on the side of disqualifying the whistleblower. In such instances, disqualification prevents the setting of precedent that might incentivize future whistleblowers to engage in unethical or illegal activities.

Both the Action Tenet and the above-stated presumption are supported by the Universal Alignment Assumption, which states that the “underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context.” See

~~~~content:
~~~~The element “useful” means that the evidence provided by the whistleblower must have had a material impact on the adjudication. The term "material impact" here does not imply that the adjudication process would have been impossible to resolve without the whistleblower's evidence. Instead, the evidence provided by the whistleblower can still be considered “useful” or of “material impact” if it serves a supportive role in the adjudication, even if it does not play a central or decisive part. The evidence simply needs to contribute meaningfully to the investigation, regardless of the extent of its influence. The Governance Facilitators ultimately have broad discretion here in awarding the bounty.

It is important to note that the payment of the whistleblower bounty is dependent on the outcome of the decision. If the Facilitators rule in favor of the AD, the bounty should not be awarded. If the Facilitators rule against the AD, the bounty should be awarded if the whistleblower has responsibly submitted useful evidence.

~~~~content:
~~~~For Ecosystem Actors appointed to the Emergency Response Group, fulfilling the responsibilities of this role is as critical to their overall performance evaluation as their customary deliverables.

The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members’ failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.

If the deficient Emergency Response Group Member is an Ecosystem Actor individual, the individual should be removed from the Group.

If the deficient Emergency Response Group Member is part of an Ecosystem Actor team, the specific member who has failed to meet requirements should be removed from the Group.

If different Emergency Response Group Members from the same Ecosystem Actor team consistently fail to meet requirements, the Ecosystem Actor team as a whole should be removed from the Group.

The removal of a Member from the Group is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.

When an Ecosystem Actor is removed from the Emergency Response Group for deficient performance, the Support Facilitators must transparently announce this action via a post to the Sky Forum. Further, the removal must be incorporated into the evaluation of the Ecosystem Actor’s overall performance.

The Support Facilitators has the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

~~~~For an Alignment Conserver who has been appointed to the Emergency Response Group, the requirements of this role become as critical to the assessment of their overall performance as their customary obligations.

The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members’ failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.

Where the deficient Member is an Alignment Conserver, that Member should be derecognized pursuant to 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
.

Where the deficient Alignment Conserver is the Support Facilitators, the Protocol Security Workstream Lead and a majority of active Scope Facilitators must reach consensus in order to initiate a derecognition proceeding against the Support Facilitators. Once this threshold is met, the procedure defined in 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
 should be followed. In the interim, other Scope Facilitators must step in temporarily to coordinate emergency response.

The initiation of derecognition is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators (or other Scope Facilitator) and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.

When an Alignment Conserver is removed from the Emergency Response Group and derecognized for deficient performance, the Governance Facilitators must transparently announce this action pursuant to 
A.1.4.10.1 - Derecognition Notice
.

The Support Facilitators have the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the Alignment Conserver’s derecognition and removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

~~~A.1.9.2.1 - Pause Delay - core
~~~content:
~~~The GSM (Governance Security Module) Pause Delay parameter sets the minimum amount of time after an Executive Vote has passed before changes will come into effect in the Sky Protocol. 

Once an Executive Vote passes, the GSM Pause Delay must pass before the changes within that Executive Vote can affect the Sky Protocol. The Sky Protocol only has one GSM Pause Delay, and all parameter changes are subject to it. The GSM Pause Delay is usually expressed in terms of hours.

It is possible to move functionality outside of the GSM Pause Delay; however, this requires additional engineering work. A list of exceptional functionality can be found in 
A.1.9.2.2 - Exceptions
.

~~~~A.1.9.2.1.1 - Pause Delay Adjustment - core
~~~~content:
~~~~Adjusting the GSM Pause Delay parameter is a manual process that requires an Executive Vote. Changes to the GSM Pause Delay are subject to the pre-change GSM Pause Delay.

An increase to the GSM Pause Delay parameter should be considered if the risk of governance attack is considered especially high for whatever reason. In the past, the GSM Pause Delay has been increased due to the risk from flash loans combined with increasing liquidity of the MKR token on the open market.

A decrease should be considered if time-critical governance actions are projected to be needed in the near future. For example, if extreme market volatility is expected, it may be beneficial to reduce the GSM Pause Delay temporarily to allow Governance to better react to the changing conditions.

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.1 - Executive Drop Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The MCD_PAUSE contract manages the general governance timelock of the GSM Pause Delay; however, it also contains an in-built exception to its own rule.

The executive drop functionality allows a successful governance proposal to cancel a previous governance proposal that has not yet passed the GSM Pause Delay period and been executed. As in any other situation, the new Executive proposal must be the hat proposal, meaning more SKY is voting for it than is voting for any other Executive proposal.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to prevent a malicious attack on the protocol if they are able to exceed the attacker’s SKY weight before the GSM Pause Delay expires.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that a malicious attacker may be able to delay or permanently block a legitimate governance proposal.

~~~~content:
~~~~The OSM_MOM contract manages the freezing of Sky’s oracles. The freeze functionality allows a successful governance proposal to immediately freeze the oracle price for any or all of the vault types in the Sky Protocol. Once frozen, the oracle price will remain at its current value.

The oracle cannot be unfrozen without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay as part of a regular governance proposal.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that the oracles may be frozen by an attacker in order to either:

• Prevent an expensive liquidation.

• Take advantage of a significant drop in collateral prices to mint unbacked USDS.

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.3 - Debt Ceiling Breaker Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The LINE_MOM contract manages the breaker for the Debt Ceilings of a configurable subset of the vault types in the Sky Protocol. This Debt Ceiling Breaker allows a successful governance proposal to reduce the debt ceilings of a pre-configured whitelist of vault types to zero without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay to expire.

The Debt Ceiling Breaker affects both the Debt Ceiling and the Maximum Debt Ceiling of a given vault type when activated, disabling the Dynamic Debt Ceiling functionality for that vault type if enabled. To reverse the effect, parameters of affected vault types must be reconfigured with an Executive Vote which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The whitelist may be configured via a successful governance proposal, but must wait for the GSM Delay before changes come into effect. The whitelist is defined in 
A.1.9.2.2.3.1 - Debt Ceiling Breaker Exception Whitelist
 and can be changed via the Weekly Governance Cycle.

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.4 - Liquidations Circuit Breaker Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The CLIPPER_MOM contract manages the circuit breaker for vault types using Liquidations 2.0. The circuit breaker functionality allows a successful governance proposal to impose Sky Governance’s choice of limitations on liquidations for any or all of the vault types in the Sky Protocol.

• Level 0 - Liquidations Enabled - The breaker is not tripped, new vaults can be liquidated and old liquidations can proceed.

• Level 1 - New Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations can take place.

• Level 2 - New Liquidations and Resets Disabled - No new liquidations can take place. No existing auctions can be reset if they expire.

• Level 3 - All Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations, no resets, no bidding in active auctions.

This functionality is exceptional because liquidations at non-market prices have the potential to be irreversibly damaging to both users and the Sky Protocol. The circuit breaker allows Sky Governance to attempt to limit the damage in the event of an issue affecting liquidations without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay.

Additionally, the contract allows for permissionless activation of the circuit breaker, if the price decrease in a collateral exceeds a preset percentage value between oracle price updates. The permissionless activation triggers the circuit breaker at Level 2 because both new auctions and resets reference the current oracle price.

When Level (0, 1, 2, 3) of liquidations circuit breaker is altered via Executive Vote, Sky Governance has the ability to set locked time, which is a specified duration which needs to pass before the liquidations circuit breaker can be triggered again via permissionless activation.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that liquidations may be halted by an attacker in order to either:

• Prevent an expensive liquidation.

• Take advantage of a significant drop in collateral prices to mint unbacked USDS.

~~~~~A.1.9.2.2.4.1 - Liquidations Circuit Breaker Exception Price Tolerance - core
~~~~~content:
~~~~~Breaker Price Tolerance is a parameter which determines the condition for the permissionless activation of circuit breaker. Adjusting the Breaker Price Tolerance requires an Executive Vote, which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The Breaker Price Tolerance is expressed as a number between zero and one, and works with the following equation: 
next_oracle_price < current_oracle_price * breaker_price_tolerance
.

In instances where the price oracle model does not support the price delay function, the permissionless activation of the liquidation circuit breaker ceases to function, since there is no next oracle price.

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.5 - Direct Deposit Breaker Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The DIRECT_MOM contract manages the breaker for Direct Deposit Modules (D3Ms). The breaker functionality allows a successful governance proposal to disable any or all of the active D3Ms. In practice, this will set the bar parameter to zero, which (contrary to intuition) disables the module by setting the allowed Debt Ceiling to zero. At this point, no further USDS can be minted through the Direct Deposit Module. To reverse the effect, parameters of affected Direct Deposit Modules must be reconfigured with an Executive Vote which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that a given line of USDS credit is unexpectedly shut down. This has the potential to disrupt the protocol in question, which may impact Sky indirectly.

Keepers can use the contract to attempt to maintain a Target Available Debt in a given vault type. The contract modifies the debt ceiling up or down to maintain a level of available debt.

This functionality is exceptional so that the Sky protocol can react to changes in debt demand more quickly than waiting for the GSM delay.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is a theoretical griefing attack on the IAM that prevents debt from being accessible in affected vault types.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to react faster in an emergency. Freezing markets does not allow for new supplies or borrows, while pause restricts all market functionality, including deposits/withdrawals/borrows/repays and liquidations.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~The SparkLend Security Access Multisig
 
can only be used in urgent or emergency situations (e.g., potential code exploits). Such situations are characterized by the fact that 1) they have the potential to harm the Sky Ecosystem or SparkLend users; and 2) the preparation time required for an Executive Vote would leave the ecosystem vulnerable to harm (e.g., an exploit).

The Multisig should be used to prevent technical vulnerabilities; prevent unwanted functionality of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system (e.g., price oracles); or prevent unwanted usage of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system which deviates from intended behavior.

The Multsig can also be used in cases where a vulnerability or exploit is discovered in other protocols using the same codebase as SparkLend, and a timely action can prevent or mitigate the damage. 

The Governance Facilitators must ensure that use of the Multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with the requirements defined herein.

~~~~~A.1.9.3.1.1 - Multisig - annotation
~~~~~content:
~~~~~The element “multisig” refers to a blockchain wallet implemented as a smart contract and requiring multiple signers to approve transactions.

A blockchain wallet has an address associated with it and can hold cryptocurrency assets as well as interact with smart contracts. The address of a blockchain wallet may be granted privileged access to interact with other smart contracts, allowing the owner of the wallet to perform functions not available to other users.

A multisig allows the control of a wallet to be shared among the signers based on specified parameters, including the number of signers and how many signers are needed to approve each transaction. This allows a wallet to be more safely managed: for instance, a multisig prevents the possibility that a single signer could take malicious action and allows the signers to be updated if necessary.

~~~Emergency Spells are expedited ad hoc spells that, while typically compliant with all customary quality-assurance processes, do not adhere to the normal spell cadence. Emergency Spells solve the root issue of an emergency / urgent situation impacting the Protocol and are used when a rapid response time is needed. The Support and Governance Facilitators are responsible for managing the use of Emergency Spells pursuant to

~~~A.1.9.4.2 - Standby Spells - core
~~~content:
~~~A subset of Emergency Spells is Standby Spells.

Standby Spells allow Sky Governance to bypass the GSM Pause Delay and directly perform crucial actions such as stopping an oracle, setting a debt ceiling to zero, disabling a D3M integration, or stopping liquidations for a collateral. Standby Spells or the factory contracts used to deploy them are reusable, meaning they can be executed several times if needed, or voted on again on a later date to be executed again.

The subdocuments herein specify the authorized use of Standby Spells.

~~~~A.1.9.4.2.1 - Standby Spells Definition - core
~~~~content:
~~~~Sky Protocol uses circuit-breakers to mitigate undesired scenarios, which circuit-breakers are called MOM contracts. MOM contracts must first be triggered through a spell, after which they bypass the GSM Pause Delay and can immediately act on the Protocol. See 
A.1.9.2.2 - Exceptions
.

In emergency scenarios, time is a scarce resource. Therefore, Standby Spells are used in validated emergency scenarios to trigger a MOM contract. In an emergency situation, spell teams can then focus on crafting an ad hoc Emergency Spell to solve the root cause of an issue, if appropriate. Due to Standby Spells, it is no longer necessary in an emergency for spell teams to spend time crafting and reviewing a spell whose sole purpose is to trigger a mitigation of the issue, i.e., the MOM contract.

Standby Spells open new attack vectors that must be mitigated pursuant to

 and 
A.1.8.1.5.2 - Incident Categorization

The decision to use a Standby Spell is reserved for the Support Facilitators; where possible, the Support Facilitators should consult with the responsible Facilitator of the impacted Scope(s) and any relevant Scope Advisor(s). See 
A.1.8.1.4 - Facilitators’ Roles And Responsibilities
.



• The Support Facilitators must explicitly communicate the decision to use a Standby Spell in the secure, private communication channel specified in 
A.1.8.1.3.1 - Emergency Response Signal Group
 or on a “war room” video call.

• If the decision to use a Standby Spell is first reached on a video call, the Support Facilitators are required thereafter to promptly document their decision in the secure, private communication channel specified in 
A.1.8.1.3.1 - Emergency Response Signal Group
.



• After the Support Facilitators decide to use a Standby Spell, TechOps must promptly trigger an incident to the Emergency Response Group as specified in

~~~A.1.10.1.1 - Edits To The Atlas - core
~~~content:
~~~The Operational Weekly Cycle may be used to edit the Atlas only if the pertinent Atlas document specifies that it, or a related unit of governance logic which it expressly controls, is modifiable through the Operational Weekly Cycle.

The general rule is that an Operational Weekly Cycle proposal requires a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote. The general rule, by default, is assumed wherever the Atlas provides that a document, or a unit of governance logic controlled by said document, is modifiable through the Operational Weekly Cycle.

Any exception to the general rule must be specifically stated in the pertinent Atlas document. The possible exceptions include documents that can be modified subject to a Governance Poll only; and documents that can be modified subject to an Executive Vote only, without requiring a previous Governance Poll.

~~~~content:
~~~~A Weekly Poll (”Governance Poll” or “Poll”) is a non-binding poll that determines the bi-weekly Executive Vote contents. In this context, a non-binding weekly poll refers to the fact that a weekly poll cannot change the system parameters independently; it merely dictates what will be included in the next Executive Vote.

Governance Polls occur on-chain and are used to measure the sentiment of SKY voters. Polls often run concurrently, allowing voters to participate in any number of them at the same time. Polls may have different formats like Binary Voting, Instant Run-Off Voting, or Approval Voting depending on the topic. The voting period of a given Governance Poll varies; the most common are three (3) and fourteen (14) day periods. Concurrently-posted polls do not necessarily have the same voting periods.

~~~~A.1.10.1.2.3 - Definition Of Executive Vote - core
~~~~content:
~~~~An Executive Vote (also “Executive”) is a formalized governance proposal that requires on-chain voting. Through the Executive Vote mechanism, SKY holders steward Sky Governance by voting on Executive proposals that pertain to operations maintaining the Protocol. Executive Votes execute technical changes to the Sky Protocol.

The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks. Its contents are often determined by weekly Governance Polls that pre-approve the inclusion of proposals in the Executive Vote. However, the Atlas can explicitly authorize proposals to go directly to an Executive Vote.

Note that the terms ‘Executive’ and ‘spell’ are distinct concepts. 

The term ‘Executive’ or ‘Executive Vote’ is used in all instances where the formal governance vote is being referenced. The term ‘Executive Process’ refers to the end-to-end process of the development of an Executive Vote, in which Facilitators, spell teams (also referred to collectively as the “Governance Security Engineering Team”) and other recognized Ecosystem Actors participate. 

The term ‘spell’ refers to the smart contract that executes the changes to the protocol approved by Sky Governance in an Executive Vote. Generally, when referring to spell team operations and their technical outcome or product (including code base, code operations, code reviews and code quality), the term ‘spell’ will be used. 

The term ‘spell process’ refers to the end-to-end process of developing a spell, a process in which the Governance Facilitators and the current spell team participate. The term ‘spell development process’ is a subset of the ‘spell process’ and pertains solely to the technical development of the spell by the current spell team.

~~~A.1.10.1.3 - Full Cycle Breakdown - core
~~~content:
~~~Every Monday, the Operational Weekly Cycle begins. It implements standard recurring operational decisions, proposed in the form of polls.

Operational Weekly Cycle proposals (”proposals”) can be proposed by Facilitators and recognized Ecosystem Actors. The proposals should be posted to the Sky Forum by Friday at 8:00 am UTC to ensure the Governance Facilitators have sufficient time to prepare the needed polls for the following Monday.

After confirming that the proposer has the authority to request a poll, the relevant Scope Facilitator must post an explicit approval of the poll request as a reply to the proposer’s Forum thread. The Governance Facilitators must then prepare and publish the Governance Poll.

The Operational Weekly Cycle polls run for three days.

The outcome of the polls determines the contents of the upcoming Executive Vote.

The Governance Facilitators confirm the Executive Vote contents and deliver the Executive Sheet to the spell team. The spell team prepares and reviews the Mainnet spell. The spell team deploys the Mainnet spell; and then creates and reviews a Mainnet fork.

The Governance Facilitators add the Executive Vote to the Voting Portal and communicate this to the Sky Ecosystem community. The Executive Vote has an expiration of thirty (30) days; if an Executive proposal does not pass within this timeframe, it expires and can no longer have any effect on the Sky Protocol.

These two subtypes differ in terms of the permissioned parties authorized to trigger a proposal and the governance mechanisms involved. For instance, the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle implements edits to the Atlas via the mechanism of a Governance Poll only. The Operational Weekly Cycle can action changes to the Protocol that require Atlas edits, and generally requires both a Governance Poll and an Executive Vote.

To trigger a Proposal, the Prime Delegate must post a reply to the Author’s Weekly Cycle Proposal on the Forum. The Prime Delegate’s post should signal their intent to trigger the Weekly Cycle Proposal. 

Where more than one Prime Delegate posts an intention to trigger a Weekly Cycle Proposal, the first Prime Delegate to post a reply to the Author’s Forum post shall be treated as the triggering Prime Delegate.

This “staking” requirement of one month’s worth of budget remains in effect until the triggered Proposal is fully resolved - that is, until either (1) the Proposal is rejected by the Governance Facilitators for misalignment, or (2) a Sky Governance vote on the Proposal concludes in an approval or rejection. If the Proposal is voted down or rejected for misalignment, the PD will lose their entire AD Buffer.

Aligned
Paying out the AD Buffer would have led to Entity’s AD Buffer dropping below the required threshold of one (1) month’s worth of budget while the Proposal was still unresolved. In this Scenario, the triggering AD cannot receive payout from the AD Buffer until the triggered Proposal is voted on and approved by Sky Governance. Assuming that the Proposal is approved, the Governance Facilitators are authorized to disburse the entire contents of the AD Buffer to the triggering AD in the next AD compensation cycle. However, if the Proposal is rejected by the Governance Facilitators for misalignment or voted down by Sky Governance, the triggering AD would lose their entire AD Buffer.

~~~~A.1.10.2.5.2 - Simultaneous Edit Reconciliation Process Definition - core
~~~~content:
~~~~Where voters approve multiple Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals that seek to edit the same component or components of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle, the process described below must be followed. 

This process only applies to the specific components that are being simultaneously edited. Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.

Where simultaneous edits are 
non-conflicting / logically compatible:
 Governance Facilitators will consolidate them into a single edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other as a new component. Any action taken by the Governance Facilitators in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant polls.

Where simultaneous edits are 
conflicting / logically incompatible 
and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Proposals, a subsequent binary vote actioned via a single Reconciliation Process Poll is appropriate. 

In the event there are more than two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals, the Governance Facilitators may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.

A Reconciliation Process Poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the originating polls. The Reconciliation Process Poll will last for three days.

~~content:
~~This Section defines the Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle, which provides a predictable framework for monthly edits to the Atlas. The Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle is implemented via the Atlas Edit Proposal (AEP) framework. 

In the transition to Endgame, the Atlas can be edited through the submission of an AEP. Multiple amendments to multiple components of the Atlas are allowed to be submitted in a single AEP. A single AEP may seek to remove multiple components of the Atlas.

AEPs must always adhere to the Spirit of the Atlas and remain within the bounds of Universal Alignment.

~~~content:
~~~The first Monday of each calendar month marks the beginning of the Monthly Governance Cycle.

Time is inclusive and based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the Gregorian Calendar.


First Wednesday after the first Monday of the month:

◦ The Authors of Atlas Edit Proposals must formally submit their AEP before this Day.
◦ The Formal Submission must be done through a message on the Author’s Forum thread that contains the AEP.


Week 1, Friday

After reviewing the AEPs, the Governance Facilitators must decide whether each submitted AEP warrants moving forward to a Ratification Poll.


Week 2, Monday

The Governance Facilitators publish the set of Ratification Polls. The format of these is defined in 
A.1.11.2.6 - Ratification Poll Requirements
.

Ratification Polls are published to the community GitHub, submitted on-chain, and appear on the official Voting Portal.


Week 4, Monday

The Ratification Polls conclude, and each proposal or set of proposals is marked as either Accepted or Rejected by the Governance Facilitators.

~~~~A.1.11.2.7.2 - Simultaneous Edit Reconciliation Process - core
~~~~content:
~~~~Where voters approve multiple Atlas Edit Proposals that seek to edit the same component or components of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle, the process described below must be followed. 

This process only applies to the specific components that are being simultaneously edited. Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.

Where simultaneous edits are 
non-conflicting / logically compatible: 
Governance Facilitators will consolidate them into a single edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other as a new component. Any action taken by the Governance Facilitators in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant ratification polls.

Where simultaneous edits are 
conflicting / logically incompatible
 and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting AEPs they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting AEPs, a subsequent binary vote is appropriate in the form of a Reconciliation Process Poll. 

In the event there are more than two conflicting AEPs, the Governance Facilitators may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.

A Reconciliation Process poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the ratification polls. The Reconciliation Process poll will last for three days.

Therefore, Active Data documents can be directly modified outside of the standard Weekly Governance Cycle and Monthly Governance Cycle. 

Each Active Data document has an Active Data Controller document associated with it, which latter defines two elements: 

1) the “Responsible Party”, or the entity who is obligated to update the Active Data, and

2) the “Update Process”, or the authorized process by which the Active Data is updated.

~~~~A.1.14.1.1 - Conflicting Atlas Edit Proposals - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~This is an extensive Research Track. Some critical questions to be explored:

What criteria should be used to determine when two or more Atlas Edit Proposals are in conflict? Are conflicts strictly based on overlapping content, or do broader thematic or operational conflicts also count?

For instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to contradictory outcomes, how should the Governance Facilitators identify and address this indirect conflict?

What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP should take precedence?

If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?

If merging proposals in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also increases the complexity of governance operations.

If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters’ will becomes a compelling question.

~~A.2.3.2 - Primitive Process Definition Schema - section
~~content:
~~Process Definitions function as the first-class objects through which Sky Primitives transform high-level governance logic into actionable document-driven workflows. All Sky Primitive Process Definitions are structured according to a common data schema - a set of fields that describe when they can start, how they run step by step, and what they must input or produce upon completion.

The documents herein define this data schema for Sky Primitive Process Definitions, which are applied to the universal specifications for each Sky Primitive. This common data schema aligns the entire ecosystem, while each Agent Artifact automatically references and extends the universal rules to incorporate the Agent’s unique Instance-level strategies, parameters and document-driven process flows.

At present, only the Accessibility Reward Primitive and the Integration Boost Primitive specifications are structured using this schema. In future iterations of the Atlas, the schema will be applied to all Primitive specifications in this Article.

Where applicable, a Document Update can serve as a “trigger” that deterministically compels another Process Definition to be initiated by a system or actor. The

 field links to the respective Process Definition that is triggered by the Required Output.

Some processes do not need formal “Required Outputs” because the only process flow step is a simple update of an Artifact Document. In these edge cases, the change specified in 
Required Primitive Inputs
 (e.g., toggling a field to Globally Activate a Primitive) fully completes the process, effectively completing it in a single step. Once the designated Document and field are updated as prescribed, the Process is considered finalized.

~~~~Where a Process Definition has more than one set of Required Outputs, and each set corresponds to (or is “triggered by”) either a specific Input stage or a specific Mutually Exclusive Input Pathway, the Process Definition’s 
Required Primitive Input
 field must define which 
Required Output
 set is Invoked upon completion of that stage or pathway.

1. 
For Sequential Stages

When multiple sequential stages exist, each stage’s successful completion triggers its corresponding Required Output set. As subsequent stages are completed in turn, each triggers its own distinct Required Outputs, ensuring that all designated outputs eventually execute in sequence.

2. 
For Mutually Exclusive Pathways

If the Required Primitive Input process instead (or additionally) involves mutually exclusive paths, once a pathway is chosen—either manually or automatically by a specified condition—only the Required Output set tied to that pathway is applied. Outputs associated with the unselected/unexecuted pathways remain inactive.

~~~Prior to Activating this Primitive, a Proto-Agent has been created, meaning it has not yet adopted any specialized role. Since a Proto-Agent cannot perform actions in the Sky Ecosystem, it must first transform into either a Star Agent or Executor Agent to gain functionality. The Star Transformation Primitive defined herein allows an Agent to transform into a Star Agent, subject to certain conditions.

~~~content:
~~~The Upkeep Rebate Primitive allows a Star Agent (”Holding Agent”) to claim a rebate on its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees when it holds any portion of the token supply of another Star Agent (”Issuing Agent”).

Ecosystem Upkeep Fees are accounted on a monthly basis. The Upkeep Rebate is calculated on the same cadence per Holding Agent as follows:

(1) The Holding Agent’s share of the Issuing Agent’s token supply at the time the Issuing Agent pays its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees, multiplied by
(2) The total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fees paid by the Issuing Agent. For a Star Agent deploying the Distribution Requirement Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to 
A.2.3.6.1.2 -  Calculation of Distributed Tokens
. For a Star Agent deploying the Market Cap Fee Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to 
A.2.3.6.1.2 -  Calculation of Distributed Tokens
. 

This resulting rebate amount is applied against the Holding Agent’s Ecosystem Upkeep Fees due in the calendar month immediately following the Issuing Agent’s payment.

~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~This document and its subdocuments define the jurisdictional compliance rules applicable to Integrators that operate user-facing frontends that integrate with, and thus offer access to, the Sky Protocol and receive Accessibility Rewards.

Integrators are solely responsible for complying with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements related to their participation in the Integrator Program. Integrators represent and warrant that their participation and activities under the Integrator Program are and will remain in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

In connection with integrating with, and thereby providing access to, the Sky Protocol, Integrators must operate their frontends and infrastructure in compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions applicable to their services. This requires compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in relation to frontend operations, marketing, and promotions in the jurisdictions where the Integrator provides access to the Sky Protocol through the integration.

An Integrator’s right to participate in the Integrator Program is contingent upon its ongoing compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

~~~~~~~~In the near term, Viridian Advisors calculates the Accessibility Reward on behalf of the Support Facilitators. The Accessibility Facilitators then pay the Accessibility Reward from the Accessibility Reward Controller Wallet located on the Ethereum Mainnet at 
0x05f471262d15eeca4059dade070e5bed509a4e73
 within seven (7) days of the end of every month. The wallet is funded from the Launch Project and may be topped up at the request of the Accessibility Facilitators, up to 3 million USDS.

~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Accessibility Reward for each month. Operational GovOps then pays the Accessibility Reward recipient from its Buffer. Later Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Accessibility Reward payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in

~~~~~~~If it is discovered that previous Accessibility Reward calculations were made erroneously, underpayments are resolved retroactively. In cases where an Integrator was overpaid, the Star Agent associated with the Integrator must reimburse Sky the overpayment amount and can use future Accessibility Rewards that the Integrator earns to reimburse itself.

~~~~~~~The process flow is defined herein.

• The Star Agent identifies an opportunity to drive USDS adoption through an Accessibility Reward to either 1) reward an existing Integrator for driving USDS adoption or 2) incentivize a new actor to onboard as an Integrator to drive USDS adoption.

• Existing Integrators

    ◦ The Star Agent and the third party, if applicable, develop a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to the actor using either on-chain or off-chain data.

• Prospective Integrators

    ◦ Near Term process:
        • The Prospective Integrator must first apply to the Integrator program and be approved by Viridian Advisors per 
A.2.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.1 - Near Term Process
.  Post approval, Viridian Advisors issues a Reward Code to the Integrator.
        • The Star Agent and the third party develop a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to the actor using either on-chain or off-chain data.

    ◦ Long Term process:
        • The Prospective Integrator must first apply to the Integrator program and be approved by Operational GovOps pursuant to 
A.2.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.2 - Long Term Process
. Post approval, Operational GovOps issues a Reward Code to the Integrator.
        • The Star Agent develops a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to it using either on-chain or off-chain data. Where applicable, the plan should include how the Star Agent will support the prospective Integrator in including the Reward Code in their on-chain infrastructure.

• The Star Agent may also be (or choose to be) an Integrator itself and deploy a Reward Code on its frontend to earn the Accessibility Reward.

    ◦ Near Term process:
        •
 
If the Star Agent is not already an approved Integrator, it must apply to the Program and be approved by Viridian Advisors. Post approval, Viridian Advisors issues a Reward Code to the Star Agent.
        • The Star Agent develops a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to it using either on-chain or off-chain data.

    ◦ Long Term process:
        • The Star Agent must first apply to the Integrator program and be approved by Operational GovOps pursuant to 
A.2.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.2 - Long Term Process
. Post approval, Operational GovOps issues a Reward Code to the Star Agent.

• Operational GovOps submits its feedback into the 
Operational GovOps Review Document
 (created at Create

~~~~~~~~In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Integration Boost for each occurrence of the specified Cadence. Operational GovOps then pays the Integration Boost recipient from its Buffer. Later, Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Integration Boost payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in

~~~~~content:
~~~~~Pioneer Stars gain benefits and responsibilities related to the general adoption of USDS on the Pioneer Chain, and this benefit comes in two forms. 

First, during the Pioneer Phase, the Pioneer Star counts as having tagged, for the purposes of calculating the Accessibility Reward, all USDS accounts and balances on the Pioneer Chain that have not been tagged by another Star. At the end of the Pioneer Phase, all untagged USDS accounts and balances are one-time tagged by the Pioneer Star, and this tag will remain normally for the following ten (10) years unless tagged by a different Star, or retagged.

Second, during the Pioneer Phase, all USDS that is bridged to the Pioneer Chain, and is not getting the Sky Savings Rate, either through sUSDS, Integration Boost, or by being held by an Agent, counts as unrewarded USDS.

This must provide general benefit for the sake of growing USDS activity on the Pioneer Chain and cannot be biased towards benefitting the Pioneer Star. The remaining 20% of the funds going to the Pioneer Incentive Pool may be retained by the Pioneer Star as income.

~~~~The Policyholder is a specialized Ecosystem Actor in charge of executing agreements with external entities with the exclusive purpose of structuring and transferring risk to third parties through instruments such as insurances, reinsurances, mutuals, or other types of arrangements. These instruments will provide extended risk coverage for participants of the Sky Ecosystem and Agents.

The object of the Policyholder is to

• Act as a legal counterparty with insurance brokers, insurance, reinsurance, underwriters, or risk management companies.

• Act as a policyholder of insurance contracts, which will have as beneficiaries participants of the Sky Ecosystem.

• Hire suppliers and contractors necessary for the operation of self-insurance or insurance instruments, such as 

◦ The Resilience Technical Committee for claim management 

◦ Managers, Directors, and other executive staff of the legal vehicle. The power of directors will be limited to administrative and operative roles.

Sky Governance will have all necessary control mechanisms over the Policyholder:

• Sky Governance can designate and remove Directors, Supervisor, and Committees

• Sky Governance can instruct the entity to act and ratify decisions

• Power of directors is limited to administrative/operative roles

• The Policyholder will not manage Sky's assets nor will be legally affiliated with Sky.

The setup and operational budget of the legal vehicle will be sourced initially from the 
A.2.8.1.1.1.1.1 - Resilience Fund Current Budget
. This is intended to move later to a separate budget.

ll bounty payouts are handled by Sky Governance. Upon confirmation, bug bounty payouts should be included in the next possible Executive Vote. 
This would involve sending USDS directly from the protocol’s buffer to the whitehat hacker.

Immunefi will publicly contact one of the Governance Facilitators with the request, including a specification of the respective vulnerability report, the requested amount and the Ethereum mainnet addresses of the beneficiaries. This should also include the payment details of the Immunefi fee, if it applies. Immunefi and the Sky Governance Facilitators should make sure the payout is made within one full calendar month after the report was approved.

For Bug Bounty rewards over USD 1,000,000: after the first million is paid out, the remaining amount is paid out over time with up to USD 1,000,000 per consecutive month until the determined amount for payout is reached.

~~~~~A.3.3.1.1.1.1 - Introduction - core
~~~~~content:
~~~~~Different risk factors may apply to varying degrees to particular types of investments. For example, investments through decentralized lending markets are subject to credit risk but not legal risk. As such, the risk framework contains methodologies for calculating the First Loss Capital required with respect to different risk factors. The First Loss Capital requirements for each risk factor relevant to an investment are then added together to arrive at the total First Loss Capital required.

~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~To capture exposures related to rehypothecation, the First Loss Capital framework utilizes the concept of “depth levels”. The first depth level relates to exposures that have not been rehypothecated. The second depth level relates to additional exposures from the rehypothecated portion of first depth level exposures. The possibility of further lending from re-lent positions should be accounted for, either as an adjustment to the second depth level exposure or through incorporation of additional depth levels.

For example, if there are $30 million of DAI borrowings and $70 million of USDC borrowings that are collectively backed by $240 million of WETH and $60 million of WBTC, then 
debt_backed
 for the DAI market and the WETH collateral would be $24 million.

~~~~A Peg Stability Module (”PSM”) allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for Dai or USDS at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing Dai or USDS. The PSM contract was designed with Stablecoin collateral in mind, allowing users to swap other Stablecoins for Dai or USDS at a fixed rate to aid with keeping Dai or USDS pegged to one (1) USD.

A PSM operates similarly to a regular vault type with a zero Stability Fee and a liquidation ratio of 100% that can only be accessed through a user-facing smart contract containing the relevant swap functions. Unlike regular vaults, users of the PSM do not retain ownership of the asset and borrow Dai or USDS. Instead, PSM users swap the asset directly for Dai or USDS.

Whenever the total amount of USDC in the PSM, plus the total amount of USDC in GUNI pools exceeds 700 million, USDC must be transferred from the PSM to Coinbase Custody to bring the total amount of USDC in the PSM, plus the total amount of USDC in the GUNI pools, to 550m USDC.

~~~Arrangers are Ecosystem Actors who specialize in sourcing, negotiating, structuring, and reporting on Real World Assets, as well as maintaining and monitoring the underlying Arranged Structures used by the Sky Protocol. The Arrangers manage a restricted function on the Arranged Structure Conduit that allows them to send assets onwards to the predetermined blockchain account of the Arranged Structure.

Arrangers are generally prohibited from occupying any position where they could cause damage or loss to the Sky Ecoystem, notwithstanding delays or inconveniences.

After the Arranged Structures are established and assets are allocated, Arrangers must not have the capability to operate or influence the legal and operational structure’s asset operations in any manner that could cause significant harm or losses to the stability of USDS. 

Arrangers are directly approved by SKY voters, and all LRA collateral exposure must be structured by an approved Arranger.

• Blocktower

Following the voluntary offboarding of Monetalis as an active Arranger, the Clydesdale RWA Arranged Structure must be wound down by the Stability Facilitator in collaboration with Monetalis or another suitable entity that can serve as an interim Arranger. This process must ensure a smooth and orderly wind-down of the assets within Clydesdale to minimize fees and maximize returns.

~~~A.3.5.3.3 - Reporting And Stress Test Requirements - core
~~~content:
~~~Arrangers must publish monthly reporting on each Arranged Structure they have arranged. 

Every six (6) months, Arrangers are also required to publish a stress test analysis that demonstrates how the structures would perform under historical financial crisis scenarios and other hypothetical scenarios.

The Stability Facilitators must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Stability Facilitators must propose a Governance Poll for warning, temporarily deactivating, or permanently offboarding the Arranger and/or the Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.

To be considered compliant, Arrangers’ monthly reports must satisfy the requirements of one of the following documents:

•
A.3.5.3.3.1 - Monthly Arranger Report Requirements


• 
A.3.5.3.3.2 - Access To Accounts

~~~~The following information must be included in the monthly Arranger report. Each item must be reported for at least the start and end date of the reporting period. If these dates fall on days when markets are closed, the first business day after the start date and the last business day before the end date may be used instead.

• Cash balance.

• Cash income over the reporting period. Any income over $20,000 in value should be broken out as its own line item, and an explanation provided for any non-recurring or non-ordinary expenses.

• Cash expenses over the reporting period. Any expense over $20,000 in value should be broken out as its own line item, and an explanation provided for any non-recurring or non-ordinary expenses.

• Market value of publicly traded equities, ETFs, and mutual funds.

• Market value (the closing price) of publicly traded debt securities. Debt securities that are investment grade and less than 12 months from maturity may alternatively be reported at cost basis + linearly recognizing scheduled interest income.

• A valuation for illiquid or privately traded assets. This should utilize a valuation from a reputable third party with relevant expertise or follow a well-defined methodology that is explained in detail in the report.

• CUSIPs, date of purchase, date of maturity, coupon, cost basis, and face value of all publicly traded debt securities in the portfolio for the last day of the reporting period.

• USDS inflows from the Sky Protocol during the reporting period.

• Total repayments on-chain to the Sky Protocol either to a vault or for surplus. If repayments are derived from multiple sources, they should be broken out into line items for each source.

• Vault debt to the Sky Protocol.

• Copies of original statements for all bank, brokerage, exchange, custodial, or other accounts. The Arranger may redact the names for non-Arranger service providers if and only if that is a requirement of confidentiality agreements with the non-Arranger service providers.

The Stability Facilitator must publicly confirm on the Sky Forum that they have reviewed the original account documentation and verified that it supports the Arranger’s summary.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~The Liquidation Ratio parameter limits the maximum amount of Dai debt that a vault user can draw from their vault given the value of their collateral locked in that vault. In practice, it expresses the minimum collateral in percentage terms that can support a given Dai debt. If the ratio of a Vault user's collateral to their debt drops below this value, their vault can be liquidated. Each vault type has its own Liquidation Ratio. The Liquidation Ratio for each vault type is expressed as a percentage value of the collateral that must be present in the vault to support its debt.

Changes to the Liquidation Ratio are subject to the Operational Weekly Cycle, requiring a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote.

Debt Ceiling Limit = Unlimited is defined as large enough to avoid being reached in the near future. 

The DC-IAM methodology contained in

~~~~~content:
~~~~~The Stability Fee parameter is an annual percentage fee charged on the Dai generated on Vaults. It is expressed as an annual percentage yield but it is charged on a per-block basis in Dai. The Dai from this fee is minted, added to the Dai debt for the vault, and then transferred into the Surplus Buffer which is under the control of Sky Governance. Each vault type has its own Stability Fee that can be adjusted by the Stability Facilitators. 

The Stability Facilitators must regularly update Vault Types’ Stability Fee according to requirements defined in the subdocuments below. The Stability Scope Advisors must develop a Rate System which can be used to set various interest rates, including the rates for Core Crypto vaults and the minimum lending rate for future Agents. The Rate System must be based on external benchmarks including the risk-free rate and the highest current sustainable rate in crypto financial markets. These rates should act as the lowest and highest base rates to which additional spreads can be added to better reflect the risks involved in specific lending activities.

The Rate System must be dynamic, based on the state of Actively Stabilizing Collateral in the system, and naturally move the state towards the required level of Actively Stabilizing Collateral defined in 
A.3.4 - Asset Liability Management

~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~The 
line
 parameter refers to the maximum value for the Debt Ceiling that the DC-IAM will allow in the given vault type. When using the DC-IAM to manage the Debt Ceiling of a vault type, the 
line
 parameter essentially replaces the Debt Ceiling parameter for that vault type. Rather than Sky Governance setting the Debt Ceiling directly, they will need to set the Maximum Debt Ceiling (
line
) in the DC-IAM. The 
line
 parameter is defined in Dai.

The Maximum Debt Ceiling is defined in 
A.3.8.1.1.2.2 - Debt Ceiling Limit
 and is currently unlimited.

~~~~~~The Ceiling Increase Cooldown (
ttl
) parameter controls how frequently the Debt Ceiling can be increased by the DC-IAM. If a user attempts to use the DC-IAM to increase the Debt Ceiling of a vault type before this time expires, the transaction will fail to execute and the Debt Ceiling will remain unchanged. The 
ttl
 parameter in combination with the 
gap
 parameter enforces a maximum rate at which debt usage can increase over time using a given vault type. These parameters should be set such that the maximum increase over time can accommodate all reasonable usage of the vault type in question. The 
ttl
 parameter is defined in seconds.

 parameter is a multiplier that is applied to the starting price of a collateral auction. Each vault type has its own Auction Price Multiplier that can be adjusted by Sky Governance separately. This multiplier is intended to be greater than 1.0x because Liquidations 2.0 uses falling price auctions. This means that it is generally preferable for the auction price to begin above the market price and then fall to the correct value over some amount of time. The

~~~~A.3.8.1.3.1 - Legacy Context - core
~~~~content:
~~~~Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. 

There have been several instances where users entered official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically comfortable collateralization ratios (
https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836
). This is, understandably, a poor user experience. 

Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially taxable events. 

This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

~A.4.5 - Distribution Of Agent Tokens - article
~content:
~To the extent Sky invests capital in Agents and receives tokens in exchange, it will distribute those tokens to the following stakeholders:

• USDS Token Rewards users
• SKY Activation users (see 
A.0.1.1.33 - Activation
)
• SKY Seal users (see 
A.0.1.1.32 - Sealing
)

The percentage of each token distributed to each of these stakeholders is determined by Sky Governance. In each case, to earn rewards users must opt to earn the token of a specific Agent, as opposed to either (1) the token of any other Agent, (2) the Sky Savings Rate in the case of USDS users, or (3) USDS Rewards in the case of SKY Activation or SKY Seal users.

~~~A.5.1.1.3 - Recentering Maker Brand Polls - core
~~~content:
~~~The Accessibility Facilitator must run a one-off special governance poll to determine the long-term brand of the backend protocol, with 3 poll options. The poll must run from November 4 to November 7. The winning option will modify the state of the Atlas as described below. The modifications and provisions of this Atlas Document overrides and supersedes all other Documents in the Atlas, despite conflict in names, tokenomics or anything else.

The 3 poll options are as follows:

Option 1:

Keep the Sky brand as the backend protocol brand. If this option is chosen, no further changes happen and everything remains as today with the brand. The effort to transition MKR to SKY continues, and the Sky brand remains the core brand that both denotes the frontend Sky.money, and the backend Sky Ecosystem and Sky Protocol.

Option 2:

Recenter the Maker brand. If this option is chosen, Sky is kept as the brand for the Sky.money frontend, USDS is also kept as the brand for the new stablecoin - but the underlying backend protocol has its name changed to Maker, and MKR becomes the core asset of the protocol. SkyLink becomes MakerLink, SkyChain becomes MakerChain, Sky Token Rewards becomes Star Token Rewards, and Sky Savings Rate becomes USDS Savings Rate. The Maker brand is returned with its old assets, as currently seen on makerdao.com, with minimal change. SKY tokens initially continue to function exactly the same, and SKY Token Rewards would continue at the same rate. Once SPK launches, SKY Token Rewards would be turned off, and the ability to migrate from MKR to SKY would be turned off. However, SKY to MKR migration would remain permanently, with a technical modification to ensure that SKY is backed by a finite amount of MKR, rather than the ability to emit new MKR. The ratio of SKY to MKR will permanently remain 1:24,000. The governance forum would revert to forum.makerdao.com and other similar assets would also revert to Maker branding - with the exception of the main @skyecosystem X handle. What happens to the X handle would be decided in a later process when it is determined what’s going to happen with Sky.

Option 3:

Recenter the Maker brand, with a limited brand refresh. If this option is chosen, Sky is kept as the brand for the Sky.money frontend, USDS is also kept as the brand for the new stablecoin - but the underlying backend protocol has its name changed to Maker, and MKR becomes the core asset of the protocol. SkyLink becomes MakerLink, SkyChain becomes MakerChain, Sky Token Rewards becomes Star Token Rewards, and Sky Savings Rate becomes USDS Savings Rate. The Maker brand is slightly modified to better align with the USDS brand identity, and to align with its role as the maker of the StarDAOs. The logo font can be slightly refreshed and polished, and the colour scheme and general aesthetic should be inspired by the dark blue / navy “star theme” that can be seen on Sky.money in sections that describe Stars and governance. SKY tokens initially continue to function exactly the same, and SKY Token Rewards would continue at the same rate. Once SPK launches, SKY Token Rewards would be turned off, and the ability to migrate from MKR to SKY would be turned off. However, SKY to MKR migration would remain permanently, with a technical modification to ensure that SKY is backed by a finite amount of MKR, rather than the ability to emit new MKR. The ratio of SKY to MKR will permanently remain 1:24,000. The governance forum would revert to forum.makerdao.com and other similar assets would also revert to Maker branding - with the exception of the main @skyecosystem X handle. What happens to the X handle would be decided in a later process when it is determined what’s going to happen with Sky.

The Accessibility Facilitator may gather feedback and input to these 3 options during the week of voting on this Atlas Edit, and use that to modify the exact language of the 3 poll options before they are put out in their final state. Any edits made in this way to a poll option will become binding on the Atlas, if the poll ends up winning.

The option that gets a plurality becomes the final outcome effective immediately from the moment the poll ends.

If Option 1 has a plurality when counting individually, but Option 2 + Option 3 combined has a plurality, then the outcome is Option 2.

The Accessibility Facilitator must prepare for all 3 options being chosen, including preparing brand assets in advance. If recentering the Maker Brand is chosen, in either form, then this must be implemented at events and other accessibility campaigns from the moment the poll ends, to the extent this is reasonably possible.

Long term implications for SKY

If recentering the Maker brand is chosen (Option 2 or Option 3), then, depending on what outcome is chosen for the Sky brand, the current SKY token may be renamed (e.g. to OLD_SKY), and a new SKY token can be created and used for a different purpose, such as a StarDAO. In any case, holders of the current SKY token would be guaranteed the ability to migrate back to MKR for an unlimited amount of time, and holders would be able to hold their original SKY tokens forever if they desire.

USDS core Stablecoin and DAI ERC20 Wrapper

The core stablecoin and product of the protocol is called USDS. It has multiple ERC20 wrappers, including the ERC20 USDS wrapper, and the ERC20 DAI Wrapper and ERC20 sDAI Wrapper. The total supply of USDS is the total supply of internal stablecoins in the protocol that backs all wrappers. The total supply of Dai can also be calculated by summing the supply of all wrappers branded as Dai, including Dai, sDai and Chai.
