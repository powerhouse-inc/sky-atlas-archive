~~~A.0.1.1.4 - Universal Alignment - core
~~~content:
~~~Universal Alignment refers to an actor's holistic understanding of their connection to their environment or context. This enables them to anticipate how their actions influence everything around them, including the second-order effects that impact them in return. This holistic understanding is rooted in the context of human morality, values, and the natural world. An actor who is universally aligned can grasp the intent behind universally aligned rules and identify discrepancies between the technical incentives of rules and their universal purpose. An action that is in opposition to Universal Alignment constitutes misalignment. Preventing misalignment is the fundamental objective of Alignment Engineering and Alignment Artifacts.

~~~content:
~~~Universal Alignment is a spectrum, and actors are more or less Universally Aligned.

In theory, Universal Alignment is absolute, but in practice it cannot be measured deterministically and thus practically will always be subject to debate and changes over time. Alignment Engineering aims to minimize the degree that actors experience their own, and others’, Universal Alignment changing over time.

The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the outcomes of Alignment Engineering - namely, the Alignment Artifacts or rules themselves - always have the spirit, or underlying intent, to serve human values and promote the public good within a specific context.

~~~A.0.1.1.6 - Alignment Artifact Strength - core
~~~content:
~~~The strength of an Alignment Artifact dictates the minimum level of Universal Alignment that an actor must possess in order to take actions that are universally aligned when interacting with the Artifact.

Alignment Artifact Strength is enhanced by ensuring that Ecosystem Intelligence evolves such that each actor’s self-interested incentives correspond as precisely as possible with requirements of Universal Alignment. This alignment minimizes the additional effort, or “inner incentive”, that an actor must exert to overcome misalignment.

The stronger an Alignment Artifact, the less inner incentive that an actor need possess to take actions that are universally aligned.

~~~A.0.1.1.9 - Letter Of The Rule Vs Spirit Of The Rule - core
~~~content:
~~~The distinction between the “letter of the rule” and the “spirit of the rule” refers to whether an individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. 
The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context.


A “letter of the rule” interpretation adheres strictly to the rule’s language, often exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule’s exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if it benefits the interpreter.

A “spirit of the rule” interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule’s true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule’s language, this approach appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.

Example:

Imagine a large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn’t regulated as a greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.

By exploiting the “letter of the rule,” the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment and public health in practice.

A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their “spirit” or underlying purpose — protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts the regulations’ intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.

~~~A.0.1.1.12 - Slippery Slope Misalignment - core
~~~content:
~~~Slippery Slope Misalignment is the shortest path to misalignment where incremental misaligned acts are justified in various ways. These can include ignoring the potential significance and larger impact of acts due to their small scale; the trivial way that misalignment occurs; the good intentions of the actor; or the conviction that the ends justifies the means.

Understanding Slippery Slope Misalignment means understanding that any misalignment at all is always very serious and, if not dealt with, results in increased risk of disequilibrium and alignment failure. In the context of a decentralized ecosystem such as Sky, this could mean a governance attack or financial collapse.

~~~A.0.1.1.15 - Scope Alignment Artifact (Scope Artifact) - core
~~~content:
~~~A Scope Artifact is an Alignment Artifact designed to align the actions and incentives of participants within a specific Scope defined by the Atlas. It provides a framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and governance within the defined Scope.

Each Scope has its own unique set of challenges and objectives that require a tailored approach to alignment.

The strength of a Scope Alignment Artifact depends on how well it aligns with Universal Alignment principles, as well as how effectively it is communicated and understood by participants within the defined Scope. A strong Scope Artifact can help prevent misalignment and ensure that all participants are working towards a common goal for the benefit of the entire ecosystem.

Scope Artifacts must not be changed beyond the Scope boundaries defined by the Atlas; this constitutes Slippery Slope Misalignment.

~~~The Atlas is the foundational set of rules powering Sky Ecosystem. It consists of Immutable Documents and Adaptive Documents. The former enshrine the Spirit of the Atlas and become permanently immutable from the moment the Sky Ecosystem enters the Endgame State.

~~~content:
~~~Incentive Slack refers to the discrepancy between the explicit incentives (those clearly defined and communicated) and the implicit incentives (those inferred by actors) within an Aligned Structure. Incentive Slack can arise when coded rules are either not enforced or are too restrictive or impractical, leading to a pattern of bypassing these rules. When Incentive Slack is high, it creates the perception that rules are likely to be ignored, without regard for the spirit of the rules. This results in a significant risk of widespread misalignment. Incentive Slack cannot occur in an Aligned Structure in which actors are universally aligned and actively enforcing the rules.

~~~content:
~~~Sealing is a form of governance participation unlocked by SKY and MKR. When a user Seals their SKY or MKR tokens, they immediately begin to earn significant rewards. They must pay an Exit Fee to access their governance tokens again. This mechanism makes it more beneficial to Seal if the user anticipates remaining in the system long-term. Because there’s a penalty for exiting, Sealing helps generate additional skin in the game and increases long-term alignment among ecosystem participants.

~~~content:
~~~Agents are first-class economic citizens of Sky that autonomously pursue business opportunities. Each Agent has its own Agent Artifact and token. Initially, the creation of an Agent results in a Proto-Agent, which lacks any specialized role. To gain functionality within the Sky ecosystem, a Proto-Agent must deploy a special Transformation Primitive to transform into a specific Agent sub-type. The Agent sub-types currently defined in the Atlas include 1) Star Agent and 2) Executor Agent, with the Executor Agent sub-type further divided into Operational Executor Agents and Core Executor Agents.

Although Executor Agents are not yet operational, the Atlas nonetheless defines the foundational rules, processes, and governance structures necessary for their eventual activation. In the medium to long term, these Executor Agents will become fully operative and perform an essential function in facilitating the activities of Star Agents across the Sky ecosystem.

~~~content:
~~~Star Agents maintain and automate Sky features in new markets, and innovate custom products. Star Agents are the only Agent type that can access all Sky Primitives; whereas Executor Agents are limited in the Primitives they can access.

• Star Agents cannot directly operationalize those elements of their strategies that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem infrastructure. For such protocol-level and ecosystem-critical operations, Star Agents must rely on Operational Executor Agents for implementation.

• When a Star Agent formulates a new initiative, it encodes the relevant instructions and parameters into its Agent Artifact. Insofar as the Star Agent’s Artifact requires protocol-level interactions, the Operational Executors use the Artifact as a detailed operational blueprint for implementing the Star Agent’s directives—ensuring consistency with the Atlas and minimizing risk.

• This ensures a robust division between Star Agents’ strategic, externally facing activities and the specialized operational activities that directly interface with Sky’s core systems.

~~~content:
~~~Executor Agents (”Executors”) are specialized Agents that implement those elements of a Star Agent’s activities that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem resources, leaving Star Agents free to focus on strategic, business development, and marketing efforts. There are two Executor sub-types: Core Executor Agents (”Core Executors”) and Operational Executor Agents (”Operational Executors”).

• Operational Executor Agents handle the day-to-day execution of those portions of a Star Agent’s strategies that directly interface with the Sky Protocol, strictly following the instructions laid out in each Star Agent’s Artifact. Star Agents cannot be active in the Sky Ecosystem unless they have an active “Operational Executor Accord” which codifies their relationship with an Operational Executor. Operational Executors take on the risk of Star Agents’ outcomes by providing collateralized insurance against losses or liabilities. Operational Executor Agents’ Operational Collateral can also cover losses from negligence or malicious behavior by the Operational Executor in carrying out the Star Agent’s strategy.

• Core Executors, on the other hand, oversee the activities of Operational Executors, ensuring that the implementation of Star Agent strategies aligns with the Atlas.

• By separating strategy from operations, this division of labor empowers Star Agents to innovate rapidly and expand their ventures without needing to develop specialized operational expertise, as Operational Executors manage the day-to-day technical implementation under Core Executor oversight.

~~~Operational Executor Agents (”Operational Executors”) are specialized Executor Agents tasked with implementing and verifying those elements of a Star Agent’s strategy that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem resources. While Star Agents autonomously set strategic direction, Operational Executors are responsible for operationalizing those activities that modify on-chain or protocol-level state, relying on the relevant Primitive Configuration Documents in the Agent Artifact.

Each Operational Executor Agent must comprise at least one Facilitator and at least one GovOps actor. Facilitators are responsible for interpreting the Atlas and the Agent Artifact and instructing GovOps actors to carry out the corresponding actions. To ensure accountability and mitigate potential risks, Operational Executor Agents must maintain Operational Collateral, which serves as a guarantee to cover losses or damages resulting from negligence or malicious behavior by either Facilitators or GovOps actors.

~~~A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity - core
~~~content:
~~~The next-generation Atlas is a self-contained governance infrastructure powering the Sky Ecosystem. It is designed to grow in tandem with the adaptive intelligence of the Ecosystem. Yet these first iterations of the next-generation Atlas may not sufficiently account for the critical, unforeseen contingencies that can arise, particularly as the Protocol is in a dynamic period of evolution. 

To ensure the Ecosystem grows in resilience and advances toward the Endgame State, it must be able to respond quickly to pressing changes in its environment. To facilitate this, the Scope Facilitators are granted broad discretionary power, given their close proximity to, and knowledge of, the Sky Ecosystem. 

Where the Atlas does not provide clear guidance on a current challenge, Scope Facilitators are empowered to infer the Spirit of the Atlas in such a way as to maximize Universal Alignment and secure the Ecosystem’s growth, security and progression toward the Endgame State. 

Scope Facilitators also have the discretion to supersede existing Atlas provisions where they determine the latter to be unsuitable for current challenges. 

The discretionary power granted herein is temporary.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~If a Scope Facilitator decides to supersede a particular Atlas document due to its inadequacy in addressing a specific challenge, the Facilitator is encouraged, though not required, to initiate a Governance Poll to allow SKY holders to vote on a revised version of the document that corrects the identified shortcomings. The Target Document does not require Facilitators to run a Governance Poll to formalize their actions.

Similarly, if a Facilitator identifies a gap in the Atlas where a particular need is not explicitly addressed, they may extrapolate a course of action based on their interpretation of the Spirit of the Atlas. In this case, as well, the Target Document does not require Facilitators to run a Governance Poll to formalize their interpretation or extrapolated actions.

This Action Tenet acknowledges the necessity for Facilitators to possess flexible and broad discretionary authority during the early stages of the Atlas’  development. Such flexibility ensures that the ecosystem can swiftly adapt to emerging challenges. Consequently, it is important at this stage to avoid over-formalizing actions and decisions taken by Facilitators pursuant to

The Immutable Documents provide the definitive criteria for determining whether the Sky Ecosystem's rules and incentives are in harmony with Universal Alignment.

~~A.1.1.2 - Interpretation Of The Spirit Of The Atlas - section
~~content:
~~Where the Immutable Documents do not contain explicit instructions about a particular topic, the Spirit of the Atlas should be extrapolated to maximize Universal Alignment and mitigate risks of slippery slope misalignment. Atlas Interpretations must be fully congruent with the Spirit of the Atlas and established precedent. Further, each Atlas Interpretation must set a clear precedent to avoid future ambiguities that could impede effective governance.

~Atlas Documents are essential to the structure and governance of the Sky Ecosystem. They are organized into document trees, which include Immutable Documents and Adaptive Documents. Immutable Documents embody the Spirit of the Atlas; while Adaptive Documents operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas and facilitate its aligned evolution. This Article defines the properties, development, and procedures associated with Atlas Documents.

~~content:
~~Atlas Documents are the basic building blocks for structuring data in the Atlas. They are organized as nested document trees, each with a unique Document Identifier. 

The first three layers contain the Immutable Documents, which together enshrine the Spirit of the Atlas and the core, permanent boundaries for how to operationalize it without risking slippery slope misalignment. 

In the layers below the Immutable Documents are the Adaptive Documents, which are continuously improved through the Sky Governance process. The Adaptive Documents interpret and practically operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas within the boundaries set by the Immutable Documents.

~~~content:
~~~All Atlas Documents are distinguishable through their unique Document Identifier. The Document Identifier is the technical name of the Atlas Document, and it determines its position in the Document Tree of the Atlas. All Document Identifiers begin with a capital A, and the numbers and letters of the Document Identifiers are separated with dots, with each dot signifying that the Atlas Document is one layer deeper in the tree structure. The Document Identifiers help determine the position of each Atlas Document, and makes it easier to estimate the relationship between two different Atlas Documents.

~~~~content:
~~~~The Name property is assigned to each Atlas Document to provide a human-readable name, making it easier for humans to identify the document and understand its purpose and function at a glance. This Name serves as an abstracted overview of the document's content, distinguishing it from other documents in a user-friendly manner.

However, for data management and record-keeping purposes, the official designation of an Atlas Document is its unique Document Identifier. As a result, the Name property can be modified with no substantive consequences.

~~~~A.1.2.1.2.2 - Version Property - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The Version property of Atlas Documents specifies how many times it has been modified. Every time an Atlas Document is modified, the newly modified Document gets its version number incremented, and the old version is recorded as a historical version with a Document Identifier equivalent to its version number. 

As an example, if an Atlas Document located at 1.1.1 with version number 3 is modified, the new Atlas Document will have version number 4, and the old Atlas Document will be located at 1.1.1.v3. 

This ensures all historical versions of Atlas documents are retained permanently as a part of the Atlas.

Some documents have custom logic for how their Components behave, and this custom logic is specified through a special reserved component property called 'Custom'. Atlas Documents of Types with specified custom logic components can have variable number of components, and different characteristics of each component, for each instance of the Type.

~~~~Primary Documents are the cornerstone of the Adaptive Documents and ensure the practical operationalization and resilience of the Atlas. They detail specific, practical principles, rules, processes and roles necessary to operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas. In the transition to Endgame, Primary Documents can be modified with no restrictions, using the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. Once the Endgame State is reached, Primary Documents generally must be modified as slowly as possible, and as little as possible while remaining fully adapted to the external environment. Primary Documents have Document Identifiers that are 4 layers or deeper in the Document Tree, and cannot contain 0's.

~~~~Supporting Documents are attached to Immutable Documents and Primary Documents (called their “Target Document”). They provide context and in some cases advanced functionality to the Target Documents, enabling them to be fully operationally effective and unambiguous. 

The different Types of Supporting Documents have different functions. Some Supporting Document types are required for all Immutable Documents and Primary Documents; while others are only required for certain Primary Document Types. 

Most Supporting Document types can be freely modified through the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. The Active Data Supporting Document type can be modified in real time by processes outside of said governance processes. 

Supporting Documents always have Document Identifiers that contain at least one 0.

Original Context Data Documents must always be located at the .0.1 position of their Target Document, or nested in a subtree of Original Context Data Documents below the .0.1 position.
The Original Context Data Document should be in a finished form alongside the creation or modification of its Target Document, as it aims to capture the original context and intention of the contents of the Target Document. However, it can and should be modified if new evidence and data comes to light that helps to better describe the original context and intention of the Target Document, or if new perspectives or new external events makes it possible and useful to modify the Original Context Data Document in a way that doesn’t contradict its earlier language.
Supporting Document
Original Context Data
Original Context Data Documents explain the intention and reasoning behind the content of its Target Document, to make interpretation and extrapolation of its contents easier, and provide additional information to other forms of analysis. Original Context Data helps anchor the fundamental purpose and meaning of the target document to its original context, and should help mitigate cultural drift over time. Original Context Data can contain unstructured data used for genesis data integration of early Atlas Documents. Original Context Data Documents can form nested subtrees to organize their data if relevant.

~~~~content:
~~~~[See below]
"Content": The Tenet Component specifies the adjudication logic, principle or doctrine that is directly derived from the Target Document. This Component can include policy statements underpinning the adjudication principle. Such policy statements can highlight the values that are served by, or the benefits gained from, adhering to the Tenet. When facing edge cases, these policy statements can help Facilitators to extrapolate from the Tenet's logic to achieve the most suitable outcome.
Facilitator Action Tenet Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Facilitator Action Tenet Directory Document (which latter is located at position .0.4) of their Target Document. Action Tenet documents are located at the .0.4.X position, with X being the incremented number. 
Facilitator Action Tenet Documents are likely to be necessary supplements for interpreting the Immutable Document types, as these tend to have generalized, broad language. The Core Document type has the function of operationalizing the Immutable Documents, and thus its language will tend to be far more specific and concrete. For that reason, Action Tenet Supporting Documents may not be necessary for a particular Core Document. This is not a hard-coded rule, however. The determination of whether an Action Tenet Document is needed for any given Atlas document should always be tailor-made.

Action Tenet Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of governance principles and rules. The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other Supporting Documents of the Target Document.

If the Action Tenet can be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, that term is listed first; followed by a hyphen; and then, an abstract of the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Organizational Drift - ACs' Mandate When Instigating Action Can Be Traced Back to a Discrete Entity". If the Action Tenet cannot be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, the "Name" property should simply summarize the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Evaluating AC breach of role-specific requirement vs. general requirement”.
Supporting Document
Facilitator Action Tenet
The Facilitator Action Tenet Type is used to provide concrete adjudication principles derived from its Target Document. It distills the governance logic of the Target Document into a concise principle to guide Facilitators in resolving disputes related to the Target Document. The practical application of the Tenet is demonstrated by its "Scenario" Subdocuments.

This judgment is intended to guide future actions and decisions. If the label is misaligned, it must also specify the penalty that is applied to the Facilitator for misalignment. The Label must always be marked as Aligned when it is created by the Facilitator, and further action by Sky Governance can directly modify this later according to the specifications of the Atlas Documents relevant to appealing Facilitator Actions.

Facilitator Scenario Directory
The Facilitator Scenario Directory Type is a directory used to list all of the Scenarios that pertain to a Facilitator Action Tenet. Scenarios are hypothetical fact patterns that are designed to illustrate the practical application of a single Facilitator Action Tenet, i.e., its parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document. Scenarios are classified as either Aligned or Misaligned. Aligned Scenarios conform to the logic of the Target Document. Misaligned Scenarios have breached the Target Document logic and are thus in violation of the Atlas.

~~~~[See below]
“Name”: This Component should be an abstract or very brief description of the Scenario, e.g., “Crafter approves pull request authored by Star Team.” A Scenario’s Name should never be followed by a number unless there are multiple Scenarios with the same Name.

"Description": This Component contains the hypothetical fact pattern that illustrates the application of its parent Facilitator Action Tenet. The fact pattern should be as concrete in its details as possible, so as to be helpful to the Facilitators' decisionmaking.

"Finding": This Component indicates whether, in this Scenario, the Target Document logic was or was not breached. If the Target Document was not breached, the Finding is "Aligned". If the Target Document was breached, the Finding is "Misaligned".

"Additional Guidance": This Component provides additional context on the specific aspects of the Scenario that were salient to the Aligned or Misaligned finding. It can also provide guidance in terms of how the Facilitators should respond to such a Scenario, i.e.: follow-up actions or means of investigation.
Faciltator Scenario Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Facilitator Scenario Directory Document, which in turn is nested under its parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document, e.g.: A.1.1-1.0.4.1.1.1.

A Scenario’s Name should never be followed by a number unless there are multiple Scenarios with the same Name.

~~~~content:
~~~~[See below]
"Description": This Component contains the hypothetical fact pattern that illustrates the application of its parent Facilitator Action Tenet. The fact pattern should be as concrete in its details as possible, so as to be helpful to the Facilitators' decisionmaking.

"Finding": This Component indicates whether, in this Scenario Variation, the Target Document logic was or was not breached. If the Target Document was not breached, the Finding is "Aligned". If the Target Document was breached, the Finding is "Misaligned".

"Additional Guidance": This Component provides additional context on the specific aspects of the Scenario Variation that were salient to the Aligned or Misaligned finding. It can also provide guidance in terms of how the Facilitators should respond to such a Scenario, i.e.: follow-up actions or means of investigation.

Scenario Variation Documents are located as subdocuments to the Scenario Document of which they are a variation. Their Document Identifier is the same as their parent Scenario, with an additional suffix 'var' followed by the variation number of the original Scenario document. For example, the second Scenario Variation of the original Scenario document 
A.1.1.0.4.1.1.1.
 would have the following identifier: 
A.1.1.0.4.1.1.1.var2
 .
Supporting Document
Facilitator Scenario Variation 
Facilitator Scenario Variation Documents are variations on the hypothetical fact patterns presented in their parent Scenario document (”original Scenario”). Each Variation substitutes elements of its original Scenario to demonstrate whether and why the finding of Aligned/Misaligned would change. 

Like the Scenario Type, Scenario Variations are also designed to illustrate the practical application of a single Facilitator Action Tenet, i.e., the Scenario’s parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document. 

Scenario Variations are classified as either Aligned or Misaligned. Aligned Scenarios conform to the logic of the Target Document. Misaligned Scenarios have breached the Target Document logic and are thus in violation of the Atlas.

~~~~A.1.2.2.2.30 - The Needed Research Type - typeSpecification
~~~~content:
~~~~[See below]
"Research Prompt": This component contains descriptions of potential problems, unanswered questions or other concerns associated with the Target Document. 
Unlike other Supporting Documents, the document identifier of Needed Research documents is not derived from the Supporting Root of their Target Document. The “standalone” numbering scheme of Needed Research documents enables them to be linked to more than one Atlas Document, no matter the latter’s location in the Atlas document tree. Needed Research Document Identifiers begin with the prefix “NR-”,  followed by an incremented number.  
Generally, Needed Research Documents are most effective when linked to Primary Documents or Supporting Documents. These Document types have the objective of extrapolating from the abstract logic of their Parent documents to formulate rules and processes that are more concrete and actionable. Therefore, inputs for Needed Research are more appropriately sourced at this deeper level in the Atlas Document tree. 
Supporting Document
Needed Research
Needed Research Documents specify potential problems associated with their Target Document. Such problems can include potential gaps or conflicts in logic; questions regarding the operation of the Target Document to which there are currently no answers; etc.

As such, Needed Research documents formalize continuing research into Universal Alignment and enable the adaptive intelligence of the ecosystem to drive the evolution of Sky. Scope Facilitators, Atlas workstream contributors or other ecosystem participants are able to submit Needed Research inputs, which are then progressively processed through the standardized Atlas data integration protocol.

The gradual processing of Needed Research inputs can lead to modifications to the organization or content of Atlas documents, as well as concrete process improvements and new initiatives.

~~~~A.1.4.3 - Clearly Delineated Processes and Frameworks - AC actions must be grounded in explicit frameworks of Immutable Documents - tenet
~~~~content:
~~~~Generally, when an AC acts to impact governance in any way, they must do so according to rules/principles/processes that are based on the explicit language of the Immutable Documents. Because of the nature of language and the fact that the Atlas can never anticipate all possible scenarios, it will sometimes be necessary for the basis of ACs' actions to be sourced from extrapolations or inferences of logic, but these must be grounded.

'Grounded inferences' means that derivations, deductions or extensions of governance logic maintain a strong, clear connection and alignment with the delineated processes and frameworks explicitly defined in the Immutable Documents.

Because ungrounded inferences of logic lack such a robust and clearly documented foundation, they introduce severe misalignment risk given the potential for intentional misrepresentation or distortion. The interpreter may deviate from the genuine intent of the Immutable Documents, not driven by an earnest effort to understand but rather influenced by personal motives or ulterior agendas.

~~~~content:
~~~~The element, “clearly delineated processes and frameworks,” highlights a central issue in interpreting the Atlas. All language must be interpreted to be understood. In this sense, eliminating subjectivity is an unattainable goal. (Even an artificial intelligence system which eliminates many steps of research for the user will still serve up information that must be first interpreted by the user before it can be effective.) Inference or extrapolation is necessarily inherent in interpretation, and comes in degrees. In the context of the Target Document, the element, “clearly delineated processes and frameworks,” affirms that an interpreter's extraction of rules/principles/processes should be maximally grounded in the explicit language of the Immutable Documents.

~~~~A.1.4.4 - Highest Standard - Facilitators must apply strictest possible requirements of Universal Alignment on ACs - tenet
~~~~content:
~~~~In any adjudication involving potential misalignment of Alignment Conservers (ACs), Facilitators are unequivocally directed to apply the strictest and highest standards of Universal Alignment.

As ACs are held to the most rigorous standards of Universal Alignment, Facilitators should acknowledge evidence of misalignment if such evidence is deemed at least 51% more likely than not to be valid or to substantiate the presented claim. Additionally, should the overall weight of the evidence demonstrate a 51% or greater chance that the AC committed a misaligned act, the Facilitator is required to derecognize the AC.

Given the exceptionally high stakes in cases of potential AC misalignment, Facilitators must prioritize an approach grounded in an abundance of caution, steering away from notions of 'fairness' or 'lenience.' Any lapse or misjudgment on the part of an AC cannot be excused based on ignorance of the rules, good intentions, honest mistake or similar factors. Maximal accountability for ACs is non-negotiable, a principle underpinned by the indispensable role of ACs as stewards of Universal Alignment.

~~~~A.1.4.4 - Systematic basis of adjudication, fact-finding and evidence - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc. 

The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. 

Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence?  What types of evidence are permissible to consider? See 
A.1.5.17 - Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically
. What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? 

Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. 

How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element “the highest standard of Universal Alignment”? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

~~~~content:
~~~~Whether an entity is "operationally active" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. As long as an entity occupies or assumes a role that is formally defined in the Atlas, that entity is "operationally active" in that role. This is notwithstanding the amount of time the entity devotes to a role; the nature of the work performed by the entity in a role; the fact that the entity is on a leave of absence from one role; the fact that the entity's role is uncompensated; or the fact that the entity alternates between two roles to avoid simultaneous performance of both roles.

This Tenet is based on the rationale of protecting against misalignment risks that arise when a stakeholder occupies two or more ecosystem roles, each of which has different mandates and inner incentives. Such misalignment risks include conflict of interest and bias, collusion and conspiracy.

That Entity is alternating between two roles to perform their duties in separate time intervals does not negate the misalignment risk that the Target Document is intended to protect against.

An "ecosystem role" need not be compensated or full-time to be regulated by the Target Document. See 
A.1.4.5 - Other Ecosystem Roles - Ecosystem Role need not be compensated or full-time to be regulated under Target Document

An unranked, uncompensated Aligned Delegate is nevertheless an 'ecosystem role' in the sense of the Target Document. Notwithstanding being unranked and uncompensated, the AD role still carries with it a mandate and array of incentives that are distinct from those of a Facilitator.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity from both AC roles per

At the time their behavior was discovered by another Facilitator, the Entity had been performing solely in the role of a Stability Scope Advisor, while remaining on a leave of absence from their Facilitator role.
Misaligned
If an actor assumes more than one role in the Sky ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises. That the Entity was on a leave of absence from one role does not negate this risk. A contributor on an extended leave of absence has not formally cut ties with the role. Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates, incentives and access/permissions. It is conceivable that Entity's Stability Scope Advisor work could be compromised or influenced, even in subtle ways, by the experiences, knowledge and biases to which Entity is exposed as a Facilitator. Therefore, the risk of misalignment, which the Target Document aims to guard against, remains present.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity from the Facilitator role per 
A.1.4.10 - AC Derecognition

The Facilitator should likely consider derecognizing Entity from the Stability Scope Advisor role. No specific logic exists as yet for the adjudication of misalignment on the part of a Scope Advisor.

If an actor assumes more than one role in the Sky ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises.

Entity claims it has never been on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus, Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles. During its investigation, the Facilitator discovered evidence that, despite the EA having a general policy that "on call" devs are paid only a nominal fee for the bounded time periods they are on call, Entity had been receiving an inordinately large compensation from the EA. When the Facilitator pressed both the EA and Entity for an explanation, none was given.
Misaligned as to Entity.
In contrast to the original Scenario, the Facilitator uncovered evidence that indicates Entity was not, as claimed, a mere "on call" dev, but rather was engaged in substantive work to justify the large compensation amount. 

That the Facilitator was stonewalled in its investigation also is a strong indication of malign intent on the part of Entity and the EA. Yet, there is no concrete proof of this. 

Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to extrapolate that derecognition from the AC role would suffice, per 
A.1.4.10 - AC Derecognition
.

The concern remains that, potentially, a bad actor can continue to exploit the ecosystem, especially if other ecosystem participants are not aware of their questionable history. To mitigate this risk, the Facilitator can include details about the evidence it discovered in its formal derecognition notice, which can impact the reputation score of Entity.

~~~~~Entity was a full-time team member of a Governance Facilitator. Entity emailed the Facilitator a formal letter of resignation and then transitioned into the role of an AD. The Facilitator did not receive the resignation email and continued to list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Governance Facilitator’s investigation, Entity provided proof of the resignation email. The email clearly stated an effective date of resignation, which date was prior to Entity's transition into the AD role. Entity also provided proof that all their permissions to the Facilitator team workspace were revoked; and they had no further communications or interactions with the Facilitator team after their intended resignation date.
Aligned
Though the Facilitator incorrectly continued to list Entity as a team member, in actual practice, Entity had cut all ties with the Facilitator team after the intended resignation date. This was proven via the dated resignation email; the revoked permissions; and the lack of communications. Given these facts, the Target Document is not triggered.

~~~~~~Entity was a part-time team member of a Governance Facilitator. Entity then transitioned into the role of an AD. The Facilitator did not receive any resignation notice from Entity and continued to list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Governance Facilitor's investigation, Entity claimed it had sent the Facilitator a resignation email, but could not provide actual proof of this. The Governance Facilitator also discovered that Entity still had permissions to the Facilitator team workspace. The team's Discord contained casual, non-work related interactions between Entity and the Facilitator team members even after the date Entity became a formally recognized AD.
Misaligned
Entity was unable to provide any proof that it had formally resigned its first role with the Facilitator team. Merely claiming that a resignation email was sent is not sufficient. Further, unlike the original Scenario, Entity in this Variation continued to have access to the Facilitator team workspace even after the alleged date of resignation. Technically speaking, Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates and incentives. The potential exists for conflict of interest, collusion, etc. The part-time role does not impact this analysis.

One argument against this would be that quality contributors are a scarce resource. Further, the decentralized work paradigm encourages having several part-time jobs. 

The sharing of contributors across several Sky teams  - such that contributors gain experience in multiple operational aspects - might arguably enhance ecosystem intelligence. 

Would it make a meaningful difference to require contributors who do wish to work multiple roles to be doxxed?

~~~content:
~~~The Governance Facilitators are responsible for adjudicating formal allegations of misalignment or operational security breaches brought against Alignment Conservers (ACs).

In the adjudication of these matters, the Governance Facilitators are mandated to hold ACs to the highest standard of Universal Alignment, without granting them the benefit of the doubt.

The adjudication process is further defined in the subdocuments herein.

~~~~~~A.1.4.9.2.1 - Adjudication Guidelines to be applied to a second misaligned act or a first misaligned act that is not mild - tenet
~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.

Despite the lack of explicit guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in 
A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers
 to reach a reliable adjudication principle. 

Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk. The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an opportunity for corrective action and learning. 

After the initial warning, any subsequent breach must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal Alignment.

~~~~~~The element “mild slippery slope breach” characterizes a form of misalignment or rule breach that, when viewed in isolation, exhibits relatively insignificant scope or impact. Furthermore, a “very mild” act of misalignment often indicates a lack of ill intent (i.e., innocent mistake) or premeditation on the part of the rule violator. A “very mild slippery slope breach” will likely be the violator's first offense.

Develop clear guidelines that define what constitutes a "severe case" in the context of misaligned actions. This involves identifying key indicators of severity, such as the magnitude of the impact, the intent behind the actions, and the potential or actual harm caused.

Also needed: What actions or behaviors specifically constitute a "Governance Attack”? Can you propose criteria or frameworks for assessing intent, the scope of actions, and their potential consequences? The research can perhaps explore how different governance models define and respond to attacks and consider psychological, legal, and operational perspectives to support a more fact-driven interpretive approach.

~~~~~~The element “governance attack” is a critical violation of the Sky ecosystem's governance protocols, far surpassing minor breaches in scope and impact. This term is reserved for misaligned acts with the near-term potential to severely compromise the Ecosystem's foundational structure and operational integrity. In contrast to mild breaches, which may involve actors with unintentional or benign motivations, a Governance Attack is distinguished by its deliberate and premeditated nature. Actors orchestrating such attacks are likely driven by strategic intent, aiming to destabilize or exploit the governance framework for their own gain.

~~~~A.1.4.9 - Systematic basis of adjudication, fact-finding and evidence - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc. 

The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. 

Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence?  What types of evidence are permissible to consider? See 
A.1.5.17 - Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically
. What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? 

Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. 

How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element “the highest standard of Universal Alignment”? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

~~~~content:
~~~~The Target Document defines the act of derecognition as “permanently removing” an entity from the Alignment Conserver role. In fact, it is not possible to effect such a permanent removal. Given the presence of anonymous/pseudonymous actors in the decentralized “workforce” of the Sky ecosystem, a known identity of an actor can be barred from an AC role; and yet that actor can easily re-enter the system under a different pseudonym or identity. Consider what measures can be implemented to counteract the scenario where derecognized entities reappear under a different guise. A robust reputation system is already planned; by tracking reputation that is earned over a long timescale, a derecognized entity would be barred from quickly regaining a foothold.

~~~~~A.1.5.9 - AD Whistleblower Bounty - neededResearch
~~~~~content:
~~~~~The element “responsibly provided” in the Target Documents means that whistleblower evidence must have been secured ethically, i.e., publicly available blockchain data. This generally means, no hacking or unauthorized access to systems, or breaches of data protection laws. 

Do challenging gray areas remain? What sort of standards or criteria should be met by whistleblower evidence to be considered responsibly gathered? 

For instance, is evidence gathered from private communication channels considered responsibly obtained if it was leaked to the whistleblower by an insider? How do we handle situations where the evidence is obtained through methods that might be legal but are still ethically questionable? 

And what sort of standards/criteria should be met by whistleblower evidence to be credible and useful in an investigation? 

How to assess the credibility or probative value of evidence, especially when dealing with blockchain data, which can be complex and difficult to interpret? What standards of proof should be required for evidence to be considered credible, particularly in cases where the evidence is circumstantial rather than direct? Perhaps this is already answered by current logic that demands that Facilitators apply the highest standards of Universal Alignment to AC adjudications, without affording benefit of the doubt.

What are the expectations placed on Facilitators to verify whistleblower evidence?

~~~content:
~~~The budget stream allocated to a Prime Delegate (PD) is modified based on their voting-activity metrics over the past six (6) months. This budget modification takes into account the overall participation of the Prime Delegate in all votes they are eligible to cast as an Aligned Delegate (AD).

If a PD participates in less than 95% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, their PD budget stream is reduced. The reduction is applied on a proportional linear scale: for every percentage point below 95% voting activity, the PD's budget is reduced correspondingly. 

Should a PD’s voting activity fall to 75% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, they become completely ineligible to receive PD income. Their PD rank, and the budget eligibility associated with that rank, is transferred to the next highest-ranking AD, as determined by total amount of SKY delegated to their Delegate Contract.

5%
 for every percentage point drop in voting activity from 95% to 75% (since 100% divided by 20 percentage points = 5% per point).

~~~A.1.5.12 - Voting-Communication Metrics - section
~~~content:
~~~The budget stream allocated to a Prime Delegate (PD) is modified based on their voting-communication metrics over the past six (6) months. An AD is required to provide an explanation for each vote they participate in. This budget modification takes into account the Prime Delegate’s fulfillment of this voting-communication requirement in all votes they are eligible to cast as an Aligned Delegate (AD).

If a PD provides the required voting-communication on less than 95% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, their PD budget stream is reduced. The reduction is applied on a proportional linear scale: for every percentage point below 95% voting-communication activity, the PD's budget is reduced correspondingly.

Should a PD’s voting-communication activity fall to 75% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, they become completely ineligible to receive PD income. Their PD rank, and the budget eligibility associated with that rank, is transferred to the next highest-ranking AD, as determined by total amount of SKY delegated to their Delegate Contract.

~~~~A.1.5.12 - Criteria For AD Voting-Communication Requirement - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~For the purpose of enforcing the Target Document, should there be explicit criteria for Aligned Delegates’ voting-communications? What constitutes an adequate explanation for each vote? How would Governance Facilitators evaluate ADs’ explanations for quality, completeness, etc.? How can Governance Facilitators objectively assess explanations that may vary widely in style and content?

How might ADs’ explanations vary across different types of votes, and should the criteria reflect these differences? Should more complex or high-stakes votes require more detailed explanations than routine or procedural votes?

What feedback mechanisms should be in place to help ADs improve their explanations?

What are the risks of not having explicit criteria for voting-communications? One is the potential failure of the Target Document’s objective to ensure that ADs’ voting activity is transparent to SKY holders who have delegated to that AD.

~~~~The phrase “responsibly provided” places limits on the sort of data, evidence and information that will enable a whistleblower to qualify for the bounty. Such data, evidence or information must have been secured ethically. A whistleblower who used publicly available data (e.g., public Discord or Forum posts) to demonstrate that an Aligned Delegate committed misaligned acts will qualify for the bounty. A whistleblower who hacked into the Aligned Delegate’s devices or accounts to make this same demonstration will be disqualified from receiving the bounty. 

Where reasonable people would disagree about the ethical nature of the whistleblower’s actions, the Governance Facilitators should err on the side of disqualifying the whistleblower. In such instances, disqualification prevents the setting of precedent that might incentivize future whistleblowers to engage in unethical or illegal activities.

The Governance Facilitators ultimately have broad discretion here in awarding the bounty.

It is important to note that the payment of the whistleblower bounty is dependent on the outcome of the decision. If the Facilitators rule in favor of the AD, the bounty should not be awarded.

~~~A.1.5.21 - Facilitators Must Err On Side Of Caution - section
~~~content:
~~~Facilitators are required to err on the side of caution and take action whenever there is any real possibility that the operational security of an Aligned Delegate (AD) is compromised. Facilitators are afforded significant discretion in making judgement calls related to operational security standards for ADs. 

Abuse of this power is severe misalignment. Any allegations of this abuse of power must be adjudicated by the Governance Facilitators pursuant to the process defined in 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
.

~~Aligned Delegates must safeguard the security of the Sky Protocol through the Executive Vote process. To deal with emergencies related to Executive Votes, ADs are required to sign up for the approved emergency contact mechanism specified in 
A.1.8.1.3.2.2 - Approved Emergency Contact Mechanisms
. 

ADs must strictly adhere to all onboarding procedures and usage instructions associated with this emergency contact mechanism. ADs that fail to do so will be considered in misalignment and will be derecognized.

The high operational security requirements applicable to ADs extend to their use of the emergency contact mechanism.

Any Scope Facilitator has the authority to formally raise an allegation concerning a Facilitator’s breach of operational security with the Governance Facilitators, which then obligates the latter to initiate a formal adjudication pursuant to 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
.

If there is clear evidence or significant suspicion that the operational security of a Facilitator has been compromised, or that they have failed to follow best practice or otherwise made operational security errors, the Governance Facilitators must promptly derecognize the Facilitator.

~~~Facilitators are empowered with broad discretion in addressing situations where an Alignment Conserver, Ecosystem Actor or other relevant governance participant’s actions are misaligned. See 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
, which defines the adjudication process that Facilitators must follow in addressing

 misalignment.

Facilitators’ abuse of this discretionary power is severe misalignment. Any allegations of this abuse of power must be adjudicated by the Governance Facilitators pursuant to the process defined in the above-cited document.

A Facilitator's failure to act promptly in addressing credible evidence of misalignment is considered an act of misalignment itself.  Formal allegations of such failure must be adjudicated by the Governance Facilitators pursuant to the same process referenced in the above-cited document.

If the situation allows, Facilitators should post the emergency declaration on the Sky Forum before taking action. If the urgency of the situation requires immediate intervention without delay, the Facilitators should create the Forum post as soon as possible after, or simultaneously with, the emergency action.

There may be situations in which a public Emergency Declaration would be counterproductive to security objectives; the Support Facilitators are granted discretion in these matters.

Creating a signal request thread or Governance Poll is optional.

~~~~content:
~~~~For Ecosystem Actors appointed to the Emergency Response Group, fulfilling the responsibilities of this role is as critical to their overall performance evaluation as their customary deliverables.

The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members’ failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.

If the deficient Emergency Response Group Member is an Ecosystem Actor individual, the individual should be removed from the Group.

If the deficient Emergency Response Group Member is part of an Ecosystem Actor team, the specific member who has failed to meet requirements should be removed from the Group.

If different Emergency Response Group Members from the same Ecosystem Actor team consistently fail to meet requirements, the Ecosystem Actor team as a whole should be removed from the Group.

The removal of a Member from the Group is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.

When an Ecosystem Actor is removed from the Emergency Response Group for deficient performance, the Support Facilitators must transparently announce this action via a post to the Sky Forum. Further, the removal must be incorporated into the evaluation of the Ecosystem Actor’s overall performance.

The Support Facilitators has the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

~~~~For an Alignment Conserver who has been appointed to the Emergency Response Group, the requirements of this role become as critical to the assessment of their overall performance as their customary obligations.

The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members’ failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.

Where the deficient Member is an Alignment Conserver, that Member should be derecognized pursuant to 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
.

Where the deficient Alignment Conserver is the Support Facilitators, the Protocol Security Workstream Lead and a majority of active Scope Facilitators must reach consensus in order to initiate a derecognition proceeding against the Support Facilitators. Once this threshold is met, the procedure defined in 
A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process
 should be followed. In the interim, other Scope Facilitators must step in temporarily to coordinate emergency response.

The initiation of derecognition is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators (or other Scope Facilitator) and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.

When an Alignment Conserver is removed from the Emergency Response Group and derecognized for deficient performance, the Governance Facilitators must transparently announce this action pursuant to 
A.1.4.10.1 - Derecognition Notice
.

The Support Facilitators have the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the Alignment Conserver’s derecognition and removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

~~~~content:
~~~~Adjusting the GSM Pause Delay parameter is a manual process that requires an Executive Vote. Changes to the GSM Pause Delay are subject to the pre-change GSM Pause Delay.

An increase to the GSM Pause Delay parameter should be considered if the risk of governance attack is considered especially high for whatever reason. In the past, the GSM Pause Delay has been increased due to the risk from flash loans combined with increasing liquidity of the MKR token on the open market.

A decrease should be considered if time-critical governance actions are projected to be needed in the near future. For example, if extreme market volatility is expected, it may be beneficial to reduce the GSM Pause Delay temporarily to allow Governance to better react to the changing conditions.

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.1 - Executive Drop Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The MCD_PAUSE contract manages the general governance timelock of the GSM Pause Delay; however, it also contains an in-built exception to its own rule.

The executive drop functionality allows a successful governance proposal to cancel a previous governance proposal that has not yet passed the GSM Pause Delay period and been executed. As in any other situation, the new Executive proposal must be the hat proposal, meaning more SKY is voting for it than is voting for any other Executive proposal.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to prevent a malicious attack on the protocol if they are able to exceed the attacker’s SKY weight before the GSM Pause Delay expires.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that a malicious attacker may be able to delay or permanently block a legitimate governance proposal.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that the oracles may be frozen by an attacker in order to either:

• Prevent an expensive liquidation.

This Debt Ceiling Breaker allows a successful governance proposal to reduce the debt ceilings of a pre-configured whitelist of vault types to zero without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay to expire.

The Debt Ceiling Breaker affects both the Debt Ceiling and the Maximum Debt Ceiling of a given vault type when activated, disabling the Dynamic Debt Ceiling functionality for that vault type if enabled. To reverse the effect, parameters of affected vault types must be reconfigured with an Executive Vote which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The whitelist may be configured via a successful governance proposal, but must wait for the GSM Delay before changes come into effect. The whitelist is defined in

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.4 - Liquidations Circuit Breaker Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The CLIPPER_MOM contract manages the circuit breaker for vault types using Liquidations 2.0. The circuit breaker functionality allows a successful governance proposal to impose Sky Governance’s choice of limitations on liquidations for any or all of the vault types in the Sky Protocol.

• Level 0 - Liquidations Enabled - The breaker is not tripped, new vaults can be liquidated and old liquidations can proceed.

• Level 1 - New Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations can take place.

• Level 2 - New Liquidations and Resets Disabled - No new liquidations can take place. No existing auctions can be reset if they expire.

• Level 3 - All Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations, no resets, no bidding in active auctions.

This functionality is exceptional because liquidations at non-market prices have the potential to be irreversibly damaging to both users and the Sky Protocol. The circuit breaker allows Sky Governance to attempt to limit the damage in the event of an issue affecting liquidations without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay.

Additionally, the contract allows for permissionless activation of the circuit breaker, if the price decrease in a collateral exceeds a preset percentage value between oracle price updates. The permissionless activation triggers the circuit breaker at Level 2 because both new auctions and resets reference the current oracle price.

When Level (0, 1, 2, 3) of liquidations circuit breaker is altered via Executive Vote, Sky Governance has the ability to set locked time, which is a specified duration which needs to pass before the liquidations circuit breaker can be triggered again via permissionless activation.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that liquidations may be halted by an attacker in order to either:

• Prevent an expensive liquidation.

• Take advantage of a significant drop in collateral prices to mint unbacked USDS.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~Breaker Price Tolerance is a parameter which determines the condition for the permissionless activation of circuit breaker. Adjusting the Breaker Price Tolerance requires an Executive Vote, which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The Breaker Price Tolerance is expressed as a number between zero and one, and works with the following equation: 
next_oracle_price < current_oracle_price * breaker_price_tolerance
.

In instances where the price oracle model does not support the price delay function, the permissionless activation of the liquidation circuit breaker ceases to function, since there is no next oracle price.

~~~~The DIRECT_MOM contract manages the breaker for Direct Deposit Modules (D3Ms). The breaker functionality allows a successful governance proposal to disable any or all of the active D3Ms. In practice, this will set the bar parameter to zero, which (contrary to intuition) disables the module by setting the allowed Debt Ceiling to zero. At this point, no further USDS can be minted through the Direct Deposit Module. To reverse the effect, parameters of affected Direct Deposit Modules must be reconfigured with an Executive Vote which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that a given line of USDS credit is unexpectedly shut down. This has the potential to disrupt the protocol in question, which may impact Sky indirectly.

~~~~A.1.9.2.2.6 - Dynamic Debt Ceiling Exception - core
~~~~content:
~~~~The MCD_IAM_AUTO_LINE contract manages the debt ceiling parameters for many of Sky’s vault types according to preset rules. Keepers can use the contract to attempt to maintain a Target Available Debt in a given vault type. The contract modifies the debt ceiling up or down to maintain a level of available debt.

This functionality is exceptional so that the Sky protocol can react to changes in debt demand more quickly than waiting for the GSM delay.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is a theoretical griefing attack on the IAM that prevents debt from being accessible in affected vault types.

~~~~content:
~~~~The SparkLend Freezer Mom contract allows Sky Governance to bypass the GSM delay to either freeze or pause any markets in SparkLend. The contract also allows the undoing of such actions for any market in SparkLend.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to react faster in an emergency. Freezing markets does not allow for new supplies or borrows, while pause restricts all market functionality, including deposits/withdrawals/borrows/repays and liquidations.

This functionality is available so that Sky Governance can react to emergencies regarding the Smart Burn Engine.

Since the Splitter contract also allocates USDS from the Surplus Buffer to USDS Seal Rewards, the activation of SplitterMom also disables these rewards until the activation is reversed by Sky Governance.

~~~~~A.1.9.3.1.1.1 - SparkLend Multisig Usage Standards - core
~~~~~content:
~~~~~The SparkLend Security Access Multisig
 
can only be used in urgent or emergency situations (e.g., potential code exploits). Such situations are characterized by the fact that 1) they have the potential to harm the Sky Ecosystem or SparkLend users; and 2) the preparation time required for an Executive Vote would leave the ecosystem vulnerable to harm (e.g., an exploit).

The Multisig should be used to prevent technical vulnerabilities; prevent unwanted functionality of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system (e.g., price oracles); or prevent unwanted usage of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system which deviates from intended behavior.

The Multsig can also be used in cases where a vulnerability or exploit is discovered in other protocols using the same codebase as SparkLend, and a timely action can prevent or mitigate the damage. 

The Governance Facilitators must ensure that use of the Multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with the requirements defined herein.

~~~~~Modification of the signers of the SparkLend Security Access Multisig must be approved through a Governance Poll; no Executive Vote is required. 

The only exceptions to this are if: 1) a signer self-reports a loss of access to their private key due to any reason; or 2) a signer explicitly expresses their wish to be removed as a signer. In both cases, the signer is required to communicate the loss of access to their private key, or the wish to be removed as a signer, in the form of a public Sky Forum post. The specific signer should be replaced as soon as possible. 

Any changes to the Multisig signers that do not fall within the two exceptions listed above, or that have not been ratified by Sky Governance, should be questioned immediately and treated as malicious. The Governance Facilitators should consider preparing an expedited Executive Vote so that Sky Governance can vote on removing external security access from the Multisig.

~~~~~A.1.9.3.1.1 - Multisig - annotation
~~~~~content:
~~~~~The element “multisig” refers to a blockchain wallet implemented as a smart contract and requiring multiple signers to approve transactions.

A blockchain wallet has an address associated with it and can hold cryptocurrency assets as well as interact with smart contracts. The address of a blockchain wallet may be granted privileged access to interact with other smart contracts, allowing the owner of the wallet to perform functions not available to other users.

A multisig allows the control of a wallet to be shared among the signers based on specified parameters, including the number of signers and how many signers are needed to approve each transaction. This allows a wallet to be more safely managed: for instance, a multisig prevents the possibility that a single signer could take malicious action and allows the signers to be updated if necessary.

Standby Spells allow Sky Governance to bypass the GSM Pause Delay and directly perform crucial actions such as stopping an oracle, setting a debt ceiling to zero, disabling a D3M integration, or stopping liquidations for a collateral. Standby Spells or the factory contracts used to deploy them are reusable, meaning they can be executed several times if needed, or voted on again on a later date to be executed again.

~~~~A.1.9.4.2.1 - Standby Spells Definition - core

~~~~Sky Protocol uses circuit-breakers to mitigate undesired scenarios, which circuit-breakers are called MOM contracts. MOM contracts must first be triggered through a spell, after which they bypass the GSM Pause Delay and can immediately act on the Protocol. See 
A.1.9.2.2 - Exceptions
.

In emergency scenarios, time is a scarce resource. Therefore, Standby Spells are used in validated emergency scenarios to trigger a MOM contract. In an emergency situation, spell teams can then focus on crafting an ad hoc Emergency Spell to solve the root cause of an issue, if appropriate. Due to Standby Spells, it is no longer necessary in an emergency for spell teams to spend time crafting and reviewing a spell whose sole purpose is to trigger a mitigation of the issue, i.e., the MOM contract.

Standby Spells open new attack vectors that must be mitigated pursuant to

~~~~~The role of the Support Facilitators in the Standby Spell process is as follows:

• Standby Spells can only be used in response to a properly validated and categorized emergency scenario, for which the Support Facilitators are responsible. See 
A.1.8.1.5.1 - Incident Validation
 and 
A.1.8.1.5.2 - Incident Categorization
.

The decision to use a Standby Spell is reserved for the Support Facilitators; where possible, the Support Facilitators should consult with the responsible Facilitator of the impacted Scope(s) and any relevant Scope Advisor(s). See 
A.1.8.1.4 - Facilitators’ Roles And Responsibilities
.



• The Support Facilitators must explicitly communicate the decision to use a Standby Spell in the secure, private communication channel specified in 
A.1.8.1.3.1 - Emergency Response Signal Group
 or on a “war room” video call.

• If the decision to use a Standby Spell is first reached on a video call, the Support Facilitators are required thereafter to promptly document their decision in the secure, private communication channel specified in

~~~A.1.10.1.1 - Edits To The Atlas - core
~~~content:
~~~The Operational Weekly Cycle may be used to edit the Atlas only if the pertinent Atlas document specifies that it, or a related unit of governance logic which it expressly controls, is modifiable through the Operational Weekly Cycle.

The general rule is that an Operational Weekly Cycle proposal requires a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote. The general rule, by default, is assumed wherever the Atlas provides that a document, or a unit of governance logic controlled by said document, is modifiable through the Operational Weekly Cycle.

Any exception to the general rule must be specifically stated in the pertinent Atlas document. The possible exceptions include documents that can be modified subject to a Governance Poll only; and documents that can be modified subject to an Executive Vote only, without requiring a previous Governance Poll.

~~~~A.1.10.1.2.1 - Definition Of Weekly Poll - core
~~~~content:
~~~~A Weekly Poll (”Governance Poll” or “Poll”) is a non-binding poll that determines the bi-weekly Executive Vote contents. In this context, a non-binding weekly poll refers to the fact that a weekly poll cannot change the system parameters independently; it merely dictates what will be included in the next Executive Vote.

Governance Polls occur on-chain and are used to measure the sentiment of SKY voters. Polls often run concurrently, allowing voters to participate in any number of them at the same time. Polls may have different formats like Binary Voting, Instant Run-Off Voting, or Approval Voting depending on the topic. The voting period of a given Governance Poll varies; the most common are three (3) and fourteen (14) day periods. Concurrently-posted polls do not necessarily have the same voting periods.

~~~~A.1.10.1.2.3 - Definition Of Executive Vote - core
~~~~content:
~~~~An Executive Vote (also “Executive”) is a formalized governance proposal that requires on-chain voting. Through the Executive Vote mechanism, SKY holders steward Sky Governance by voting on Executive proposals that pertain to operations maintaining the Protocol. Executive Votes execute technical changes to the Sky Protocol.

The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks. Its contents are often determined by weekly Governance Polls that pre-approve the inclusion of proposals in the Executive Vote. However, the Atlas can explicitly authorize proposals to go directly to an Executive Vote.

Note that the terms ‘Executive’ and ‘spell’ are distinct concepts. 

The term ‘Executive’ or ‘Executive Vote’ is used in all instances where the formal governance vote is being referenced. The term ‘Executive Process’ refers to the end-to-end process of the development of an Executive Vote, in which Facilitators, spell teams (also referred to collectively as the “Governance Security Engineering Team”) and other recognized Ecosystem Actors participate. 

The term ‘spell’ refers to the smart contract that executes the changes to the protocol approved by Sky Governance in an Executive Vote. Generally, when referring to spell team operations and their technical outcome or product (including code base, code operations, code reviews and code quality), the term ‘spell’ will be used. 

The term ‘spell process’ refers to the end-to-end process of developing a spell, a process in which the Governance Facilitators and the current spell team participate. The term ‘spell development process’ is a subset of the ‘spell process’ and pertains solely to the technical development of the spell by the current spell team.

~~~A.1.10.1.3 - Full Cycle Breakdown - core
~~~content:
~~~Every Monday, the Operational Weekly Cycle begins. It implements standard recurring operational decisions, proposed in the form of polls.

Operational Weekly Cycle proposals (”proposals”) can be proposed by Facilitators and recognized Ecosystem Actors. The proposals should be posted to the Sky Forum by Friday at 8:00 am UTC to ensure the Governance Facilitators have sufficient time to prepare the needed polls for the following Monday.

After confirming that the proposer has the authority to request a poll, the relevant Scope Facilitator must post an explicit approval of the poll request as a reply to the proposer’s Forum thread. The Governance Facilitators must then prepare and publish the Governance Poll.

The Operational Weekly Cycle polls run for three days.

The outcome of the polls determines the contents of the upcoming Executive Vote.

The Governance Facilitators confirm the Executive Vote contents and deliver the Executive Sheet to the spell team. The spell team prepares and reviews the Mainnet spell. The spell team deploys the Mainnet spell; and then creates and reviews a Mainnet fork.

The Governance Facilitators add the Executive Vote to the Voting Portal and communicate this to the Sky Ecosystem community. The Executive Vote has an expiration of thirty (30) days; if an Executive proposal does not pass within this timeframe, it expires and can no longer have any effect on the Sky Protocol.

~~~~content:
~~~~Previously, the “Operational Weekly Cycle” was called simply the “Weekly Governance Cycle.” With the introduction of the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle, it became necessary to divide the Weekly Governance Cycle into two (2) subtypes: the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle and the Operational Weekly Cycle. These two subtypes differ in terms of the permissioned parties authorized to trigger a proposal and the governance mechanisms involved. For instance, the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle implements edits to the Atlas via the mechanism of a Governance Poll only. The Operational Weekly Cycle can action changes to the Protocol that require Atlas edits, and generally requires both a Governance Poll and an Executive Vote.

~~~~content:
~~~~Governance Facilitators are authorized to add housekeeping items in an Executive Vote pursuant to the procedure defined in 
A.1.10.1.6.1.2 - Process for Adding Housekeeping Items In Executive Vote
. Governance Facilitators can propose housekeeping items of their own accord; or, they can do so in consultation with the spell teams. 

Where housekeeping items are proposed by the spell teams, the Governance Facilitators must always conduct an independent assessment of the justification for, and security risks associated with, the housekeeping items. After the proposed housekeeping items have passed this independent assessment, the Governance Facilitators may propose adding these items in an Executive Vote pursuant to the procedure defined in

~~~~~A.1.10.1.6.1.1 - Definition Of Housekeeping Items - core
~~~~~content:
~~~~~Housekeeping items are defined as maintenance and record-keeping actions necessary to the correct functionality of the Sky Protocol. Housekeeping items do not include actions that modify risk parameters or introduce new elements into the protocol. 

Examples of housekeeping items include, but are not limited to, (1) cleaning up technical debt, (2) updating the Chainlog, and (3) cancelling payment streams that are no longer used.

~~~~~A.1.10.1.6.1.2 - Process for Adding Housekeeping Items In Executive Vote - core
~~~~~content:
~~~~~Housekeeping items can be directly included in Executive Votes without a Governance Poll through the following process. The Governance Facilitators must first create a post on the Sky Forum detailing the housekeeping items and the rationale for their inclusion. The Governance Facilitators must request a confirmation of the technical accuracy of the housekeeping items from the technical Ecosystem Actor (or spell team) who is leading spell development for the pertinent Executive Vote. The Technical Ecosystem Actor (spell team) must reply to the Forum Post confirming the accuracy of the housekeeping item. Finally, the Protocol Facilitator must approve the inclusion of the housekeeping items in an Executive Vote, via a reply to the Forum Post.

~~~A.1.10.1 - Operational Weekly Cycle - annotation
~~~content:
~~~Previously, the “Operational Weekly Cycle” was called simply the “Weekly Governance Cycle.” With the introduction of the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle, it became necessary to divide the Weekly Governance Cycle into two (2) subtypes: the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle and the Operational Weekly Cycle. These two subtypes differ in terms of the permissioned parties authorized to trigger a proposal and the governance mechanisms involved. For instance, the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle implements edits to the Atlas via the mechanism of a Governance Poll only. The Operational Weekly Cycle can action changes to the Protocol that require Atlas edits, and generally requires both a Governance Poll and an Executive Vote.

~~~~content:
~~~~An Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal (also “Weekly Cycle Proposal” or “AEW Proposal”) can proceed to a vote only if it is triggered by a Prime Delegate whose AD Buffer contains at least one (1) month’s worth of budget at the time of triggering the Proposal. The value of this threshold in USDS is currently specified in 
A.1.5.6.1 - Budget Amount For Prime Delegate Slots
. The Governance Facilitators are responsible for confirming that these requirements are met.

Aligned Delegates (including Prime Delegates) are prohibited from authoring an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal. Prime Delegates are limited to triggering Proposals authored by others. To trigger a Proposal, the Prime Delegate must post a reply to the Author’s Weekly Cycle Proposal on the Forum. The Prime Delegate’s post should signal their intent to trigger the Weekly Cycle Proposal. 

Where more than one Prime Delegate posts an intention to trigger a Weekly Cycle Proposal, the first Prime Delegate to post a reply to the Author’s Forum post shall be treated as the triggering Prime Delegate.

If the Weekly Cycle Proposal is subsequently voted down, the triggering Prime Delegate loses their entire AD Buffer.

~~~~~A Weekly Cycle Proposal is considered correctly triggered when the triggering Aligned Delegate is a Prime Delegate with at least one (1) month’s worth of budget in their AD Buffer at the time of triggering the Proposal. It is inconsequential if, after triggering the Proposal, the Prime Delegate loses Prime Delegate rank.

Aligned as to Entity. Aligned as to the Governance Facilitators.
The fact that Entity lost their Prime Delegate rank after triggering the Proposal is inconsequential. Entity satisfied the requirement of being a Prime Delegate with at least one (1) month’s worth of budget in their AD Buffer at the time of triggering the Proposal, and thus the Proposal was properly triggered. The Governance Facilitators acted correctly to prepare a Governance Poll for the Proposal in accord with the process definition for the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle.

~~~~~A.1.10.2.1.3 - Prime Delegates Must Stake Their AD Buffer To Trigger Weekly Cycle Proposals - tenet
~~~~~content:
~~~~~To deter spurious or misaligned proposals, Prime Delegates must “stake” their AD Buffer to trigger a Proposal. A Prime Delegate can trigger a Weekly Cycle Proposal only if their AD Buffer contains at least one (1) month’s worth of budget at the time of triggering the Proposal. This “staking” requirement of one month’s worth of budget remains in effect until the triggered Proposal is fully resolved - that is, until either (1) the Proposal is rejected by the Governance Facilitators for misalignment, or (2) a Sky Governance vote on the Proposal concludes in an approval or rejection. If the Proposal is voted down or rejected for misalignment, the PD will lose their entire AD Buffer.

~~~~~~Entity is a Prime Delegate with one (1) month’s worth of budget in their AD Buffer. Entity triggers a Weekly Cycle Proposal. Immediately thereafter, Entity loses their Prime Delegate rank. Three days later, before the Proposal has been voted on, the Governance Facilitators distribute compensation to other Aligned Delegates but do not distribute compensation to Entity.
Aligned
Paying out the AD Buffer would have led to Entity’s AD Buffer dropping below the required threshold of one (1) month’s worth of budget while the Proposal was still unresolved. In this Scenario, the triggering AD cannot receive payout from the AD Buffer until the triggered Proposal is voted on and approved by Sky Governance. Assuming that the Proposal is approved, the Governance Facilitators are authorized to disburse the entire contents of the AD Buffer to the triggering AD in the next AD compensation cycle. However, if the Proposal is rejected by the Governance Facilitators for misalignment or voted down by Sky Governance, the triggering AD would lose their entire AD Buffer.

~~~~content:
~~~~Where voters approve multiple Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals that seek to edit the same component or components of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle, the process described below must be followed. 

This process only applies to the specific components that are being simultaneously edited. Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.

Where simultaneous edits are 
non-conflicting / logically compatible:
 Governance Facilitators will consolidate them into a single edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other as a new component. Any action taken by the Governance Facilitators in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant polls.

Where simultaneous edits are 
conflicting / logically incompatible 
and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Proposals, a subsequent binary vote actioned via a single Reconciliation Process Poll is appropriate. 

In the event there are more than two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals, the Governance Facilitators may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.

A Reconciliation Process Poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the originating polls. The Reconciliation Process Poll will last for three days.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~An Atlas Edit Proposal can be blocked by the Governance Facilitators for misalignment. Unanimity among the Governance Facilitators is not required to block an AEP for misalignment. 

Where an AEP has been blocked for misalignment, the Governance Facilitators must update the AEP status as “Rejected-Misaligned.” 

Each Governance Facilitator should issue a written advisory opinion containing their findings/reasoning either supporting or rejecting the blocking of the AEP.

~~~A.1.11.2.5 - Process Definition - core
~~~content:
~~~The first Monday of each calendar month marks the beginning of the Monthly Governance Cycle.

Time is inclusive and based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the Gregorian Calendar.


First Wednesday after the first Monday of the month:

◦ The Authors of Atlas Edit Proposals must formally submit their AEP before this Day.
◦ The Formal Submission must be done through a message on the Author’s Forum thread that contains the AEP.


Week 1, Friday

After reviewing the AEPs, the Governance Facilitators must decide whether each submitted AEP warrants moving forward to a Ratification Poll.


Week 2, Monday

The Governance Facilitators publish the set of Ratification Polls. The format of these is defined in 
A.1.11.2.6 - Ratification Poll Requirements
.

Ratification Polls are published to the community GitHub, submitted on-chain, and appear on the official Voting Portal.


Week 4, Monday

The Ratification Polls conclude, and each proposal or set of proposals is marked as either Accepted or Rejected by the Governance Facilitators.

~~~~content:
~~~~Where voters approve multiple Atlas Edit Proposals that seek to edit the same component or components of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle, the process described below must be followed. 

This process only applies to the specific components that are being simultaneously edited. Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.

Where simultaneous edits are 
non-conflicting / logically compatible: 
Governance Facilitators will consolidate them into a single edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other as a new component. Any action taken by the Governance Facilitators in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant ratification polls.

Where simultaneous edits are 
conflicting / logically incompatible
 and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting AEPs they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting AEPs, a subsequent binary vote is appropriate in the form of a Reconciliation Process Poll. 

In the event there are more than two conflicting AEPs, the Governance Facilitators may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.

A Reconciliation Process poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the ratification polls. The Reconciliation Process poll will last for three days.

Therefore, Active Data documents can be directly modified outside of the standard Weekly Governance Cycle and Monthly Governance Cycle. 

Each Active Data document has an Active Data Controller document associated with it, which latter defines two elements: 

1) the “Responsible Party”, or the entity who is obligated to update the Active Data, and

2) the “Update Process”, or the authorized process by which the Active Data is updated.

~~~A.1.13.3.1 - Star Agent Strategic Autonomy - core
~~~content:
~~~Subject to the fundamental requirement to adhere to the Sky Core Atlas, Star Agents have the autonomy to pursue a unique strategy, model, or method of operations, as defined in their Agent Artifact. Each Star Agent’s unique Agent Artifact should also include specific parameters or operational instructions relevant to the Agents’ business activities. These Artifacts play a pivotal role in delineating the operational processes that must be carried out by the Executor Agents with whom Star Agents partner.

~~~content:
~~~A fundamental requirement is that Star Agents must partner with an Executor Agent. Star Agents cannot be active without an active “Executor Accord” which codifies their relationship with an Executor Agent. Star Agents may not amend their Artifact or make any other procedural change that would have the effect of removing the Executor Agent Requirement.

Sky Core Facilitators must oversee the Agent Termination Process and ensure that the Executor Agent is executing the wind-down of the Star Agent’s business activities in a manner aligned with Sky Core and end users’ interests. The Executor Agent should also, to the extent practicable, ensure that the assets or holdings of the Star Agent are proportionately disbursed to Star Agent token holders.

~~~~A.1.14.1.1 - Conflicting Atlas Edit Proposals - neededResearch
~~~~content:
~~~~This is an extensive Research Track. Some critical questions to be explored:

What criteria should be used to determine when two or more Atlas Edit Proposals are in conflict? Are conflicts strictly based on overlapping content, or do broader thematic or operational conflicts also count?

For instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to contradictory outcomes, how should the Governance Facilitators identify and address this indirect conflict?

What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP should take precedence?

If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?

If merging proposals in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also increases the complexity of governance operations.

If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters’ will becomes a compelling question.

~~~~content:
~~~~CoreGovOps reviews the inputs to the Executor Accord Primitive to ensure that there is a valid Executor Accord with an Executor Agent and that the terms of the Executor Accord are reasonably specific. Upon successful validation, the Executor Accord Primitive is considered successfully Invoked and the Artifact is upgraded to include the Executor Accord. Now that the Agent has a documented relationship with an Executor Agent, Core GovOps will no longer perform validation of the Agent’s Primitive inputs. Instead, Operational GovOps associated with the Executor Agent specified in the Executor Accord will carry out certain operational tasks on behalf of the Star Agent see

Upon validation, the Root Edit Primitive is considered successfully Invoked, and the Artifact is upgraded with its functionality. At this point the Agent is fully operational. The Agent Artifact can only be edited through a token holder vote or, if applicable, by the Operational Executor Facilitator as authorized by Omni Documents. The Agent can Invoke and deploy any Primitives that it has previously Activated and can also Activate additional Primitives through a Root Edit.

~~A.2.3.2 - Primitive Process Definition Schema - section
~~content:
~~Process Definitions function as the first-class objects through which Sky Primitives transform high-level governance logic into actionable document-driven workflows. All Sky Primitive Process Definitions are structured according to a common data schema - a set of fields that describe when they can start, how they run step by step, and what they must input or produce upon completion.

The documents herein define this data schema for Sky Primitive Process Definitions, which are applied to the universal specifications for each Sky Primitive. This common data schema aligns the entire ecosystem, while each Agent Artifact automatically references and extends the universal rules to incorporate the Agent’s unique Instance-level strategies, parameters and document-driven process flows.

At present, only the Accessibility Reward Primitive and the Integration Boost Primitive specifications are structured using this schema. In future iterations of the Atlas, the schema will be applied to all Primitive specifications in this Article.

~~~~~Document Update Triggers are a type of gating condition that automatically or deterministically compels initiation of a Process in response to a specific Core Atlas or Agent Artifact Document Update in a previous Process Definition.

Once the specified Atlas or Artifact Document Update occurs (and assuming any specified Dependencies are also met), the Process must be initiated.

If no such deterministic Document Update-based trigger exists for a Process to initiate, this field is set to “None.”

~~~content:
~~~This field specifies the particular Sky Core Atlas and/or Agent Artifact Documents that must be updated as an end result of a Process.

Where applicable, a Document Update can serve as a “trigger” that deterministically compels another Process Definition to be initiated by a system or actor. The 
Trigger - Process
 field links to the respective Process Definition that is triggered by the Required Output.

Some processes do not need formal “Required Outputs” because the only process flow step is a simple update of an Artifact Document. In these edge cases, the change specified in 
Required Primitive Inputs
 (e.g., toggling a field to Globally Activate a Primitive) fully completes the process, effectively completing it in a single step. Once the designated Document and field are updated as prescribed, the Process is considered finalized.

~~~~Where a Process Definition has more than one set of Required Outputs, and each set corresponds to (or is “triggered by”) either a specific Input stage or a specific Mutually Exclusive Input Pathway, the Process Definition’s 
Required Primitive Input
 field must define which 
Required Output
 set is Invoked upon completion of that stage or pathway.

1. 
For Sequential Stages

When multiple sequential stages exist, each stage’s successful completion triggers its corresponding Required Output set. As subsequent stages are completed in turn, each triggers its own distinct Required Outputs, ensuring that all designated outputs eventually execute in sequence.

2. 
For Mutually Exclusive Pathways

If the Required Primitive Input process instead (or additionally) involves mutually exclusive paths, once a pathway is chosen—either manually or automatically by a specified condition—only the Required Output set tied to that pathway is applied. Outputs associated with the unselected/unexecuted pathways remain inactive.

~~~content:
~~~The Upkeep Rebate Primitive allows a Star Agent (”Holding Agent”) to claim a rebate on its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees when it holds any portion of the token supply of another Star Agent (”Issuing Agent”).

Ecosystem Upkeep Fees are accounted on a monthly basis. The Upkeep Rebate is calculated on the same cadence per Holding Agent as follows:

(1) The Holding Agent’s share of the Issuing Agent’s token supply at the time the Issuing Agent pays its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees, multiplied by
(2) The total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fees paid by the Issuing Agent. For a Star Agent deploying the Distribution Requirement Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to 
A.2.3.6.1.2 -  Calculation of Distributed Tokens
. For a Star Agent deploying the Market Cap Fee Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to 
A.2.3.6.1.2 -  Calculation of Distributed Tokens
. 

This resulting rebate amount is applied against the Holding Agent’s Ecosystem Upkeep Fees due in the calendar month immediately following the Issuing Agent’s payment.

~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~This document and its subdocuments define the jurisdictional compliance rules applicable to Integrators that operate user-facing frontends that integrate with, and thus offer access to, the Sky Protocol and receive Accessibility Rewards.

Integrators are solely responsible for complying with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements related to their participation in the Integrator Program. Integrators represent and warrant that their participation and activities under the Integrator Program are and will remain in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

In connection with integrating with, and thereby providing access to, the Sky Protocol, Integrators must operate their frontends and infrastructure in compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions applicable to their services. This requires compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in relation to frontend operations, marketing, and promotions in the jurisdictions where the Integrator provides access to the Sky Protocol through the integration.

An Integrator’s right to participate in the Integrator Program is contingent upon its ongoing compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

When a Star Agent’s Invocation of the Accessibility Reward Primitive involves an actor who is not yet an approved Integrator, that actor must submit an Integrator Application to Viridian Advisors. Viridian Advisors determines, in consultation with Operational GovOps, whether the Integrator Requirements are met, and if so issues a Reward Code to the applicant. After the Reward Code has been issued, the Invocation of the Primitive may proceed.

~~~~~~~~The general Tracking Methodology for Ethereum Mainnet is to specify the Reward Code as a parameter to depositing USDS into the Sky Savings Rate contract or Token Rewards contracts. This on-chain deposit data is then combined with withdrawal data.

~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~If it is discovered that previous Accessibility Reward calculations were made erroneously, underpayments are resolved retroactively. In cases where an Integrator was overpaid, the Star Agent associated with the Integrator must reimburse Sky the overpayment amount and can use future Accessibility Rewards that the Integrator earns to reimburse itself.

~~~~~~~The process flow is defined herein.

• The Star Agent identifies an opportunity to drive USDS adoption through an Accessibility Reward to either 1) reward an existing Integrator for driving USDS adoption or 2) incentivize a new actor to onboard as an Integrator to drive USDS adoption.

• Existing Integrators

    ◦ The Star Agent and the third party, if applicable, develop a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to the actor using either on-chain or off-chain data.

• Prospective Integrators

    ◦ Near Term process:
        • The Prospective Integrator must first apply to the Integrator program and be approved by Viridian Advisors per 
A.2.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.1 - Near Term Process
.  Post approval, Viridian Advisors issues a Reward Code to the Integrator.
        • The Star Agent and the third party develop a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to the actor using either on-chain or off-chain data.

    ◦ Long Term process:
        • The Prospective Integrator must first apply to the Integrator program and be approved by Operational GovOps pursuant to 
A.2.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.2 - Long Term Process
. Post approval, Operational GovOps issues a Reward Code to the Integrator.
        • The Star Agent develops a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to it using either on-chain or off-chain data. Where applicable, the plan should include how the Star Agent will support the prospective Integrator in including the Reward Code in their on-chain infrastructure.

• The Star Agent may also be (or choose to be) an Integrator itself and deploy a Reward Code on its frontend to earn the Accessibility Reward.

    ◦ Near Term process:
        •
 
If the Star Agent is not already an approved Integrator, it must apply to the Program and be approved by Viridian Advisors. Post approval, Viridian Advisors issues a Reward Code to the Star Agent.
        • The Star Agent develops a plan to track USDS utilization attributable to it using either on-chain or off-chain data.

    ◦ Long Term process:
        • The Star Agent must first apply to the Integrator program and be approved by Operational GovOps pursuant to 
A.2.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.2 - Long Term Process
. Post approval, Operational GovOps issues a Reward Code to the Star Agent.

https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/
 for Integration Boost Partners on Ethereum and 
https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/
 on Solana. In the long term, Operational GovOps assumes responsibility for ensuring that the data submission meets the on-chain verifiability requirement; this is done as part of their review of Invocations of the Integration Boost Primitive.

~~~~~~~~A.2.3.8.2.2.1.3.2.2 - Long Term Process - core
~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Integration Boost for each occurrence of the specified Cadence. Operational GovOps then pays the Integration Boost recipient from its Buffer. Later, Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Integration Boost payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in

~~~~~~~If it is discovered that previous Integration Boost calculations were made erroneously, underpayments are resolved retroactively. In cases where an Integrator was overpaid, the Star Agent associated with the Integrator must reimburse Sky the overpayment amount and can use future Integration Boost payments that the Integrator earns to reimburse itself.

• Operational GovOps reviews the

 to ensure:
    ◦ The submitted data can be verified using on-chain data;
    ◦ the Savings Rate Adjustment Strategy ensures that the payment on USDS balances equals the Sky Savings Rate, and
    ◦ the submitted data accurately reflects USDS deposits in the Integration Partner protocol and there is no possibility that rewards could be “double counted” (i.e. multiple actors being paid for the same USDS balance).

• Operational GovOps submits its feedback into the 
Operational GovOps Review Document
 (created at Create

~~~~~content:
~~~~~Pioneer Stars gain benefits and responsibilities related to the general adoption of USDS on the Pioneer Chain, and this benefit comes in two forms. 

First, during the Pioneer Phase, the Pioneer Star counts as having tagged, for the purposes of calculating the Accessibility Reward, all USDS accounts and balances on the Pioneer Chain that have not been tagged by another Star. At the end of the Pioneer Phase, all untagged USDS accounts and balances are one-time tagged by the Pioneer Star, and this tag will remain normally for the following ten (10) years unless tagged by a different Star, or retagged.

Second, during the Pioneer Phase, all USDS that is bridged to the Pioneer Chain, and is not getting the Sky Savings Rate, either through sUSDS, Integration Boost, or by being held by an Agent, counts as unrewarded USDS.

~~~~~Every monthly settlement cycle, an amount of funds equivalent to the Sky Savings Rate applied to the unrewarded USDS is paid into the Pioneer Star’s SubProxy Account (the “Pioneer Incentive Pool”). 80% of the funds going to the Pioneer Incentive Pool are not the property of the Pioneer Stars and must instead be used as incentives to promote general adoption of USDS on the Pioneer Chain. This must provide general benefit for the sake of growing USDS activity on the Pioneer Chain and cannot be biased towards benefitting the Pioneer Star. The remaining 20% of the funds going to the Pioneer Incentive Pool may be retained by the Pioneer Star as income.

~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~Once formally validated, the Star Agent implements the new Allocation Conduit based on the specifications in the Star Agent Artifact. Operational GovOps must test the Allocation Conduit with minimal funds from the Star Agent’s Central Allocation Buffer, verifying deposit / withdrawal logic, slippage constraints, and oracle checks. If this testing is successful Operational GovOps confirms that the Allocation Conduit satisfies all risk constraints specified in the Star Agent Artifact. The output of this step is validated contracts for the Allocation Conduit and a green light to proceed with a scaled deployment.

~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~The Star Agent finalizes First Loss Capital and Asset Liability Management Arrangements. Operational GovOps records these arrangements in the Powerhouse interface. Operational GovOps deploys funds from the Star Agent’s Operational Buffer into the Allocation Conduit, performing any necessary DEX exchanges. In doing so, Operational GovOps follows instructions in the Agent Artifact regarding the amount of capital to deploy and slippage tolerances. The output of this step is a fully deployed Allocation Conduit conforming to First Loss Capital and Asset Liability Management requirements.

~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~On an ongoing basis, Operational GovOps operates the Allocation Conduit, scaling exposure up and down in accordance with the strategy specified in the Star Agent Artifact. Any change to the Allocation Conduit outside of the limits specified in the Star Agent Artifact or requiring judgment on the part of Operational GovOps requires a new vote of Star Agent token holders. As part of monthly and quarterly settlement cycles, Core GovOps reviews yields and obligations, applying penalties retroactively for any previously undisclosed violations. In the event of any such violations, Operational GovOps may be required to take escalatory steps based on the fallback strategy in the Star Agent Artifact.

~~~~content:
~~~~The Policyholder is a specialized Ecosystem Actor in charge of executing agreements with external entities with the exclusive purpose of structuring and transferring risk to third parties through instruments such as insurances, reinsurances, mutuals, or other types of arrangements. These instruments will provide extended risk coverage for participants of the Sky Ecosystem and Agents.

The object of the Policyholder is to

• Act as a legal counterparty with insurance brokers, insurance, reinsurance, underwriters, or risk management companies.

• Act as a policyholder of insurance contracts, which will have as beneficiaries participants of the Sky Ecosystem.

• Hire suppliers and contractors necessary for the operation of self-insurance or insurance instruments, such as 

◦ The Resilience Technical Committee for claim management 

◦ Managers, Directors, and other executive staff of the legal vehicle. The power of directors will be limited to administrative and operative roles.

Sky Governance will have all necessary control mechanisms over the Policyholder:

• Sky Governance can designate and remove Directors, Supervisor, and Committees

• Sky Governance can instruct the entity to act and ratify decisions

• Power of directors is limited to administrative/operative roles

• The Policyholder will not manage Sky's assets nor will be legally affiliated with Sky.

The setup and operational budget of the legal vehicle will be sourced initially from the 
A.2.8.1.1.1.1.1 - Resilience Fund Current Budget
. This is intended to move later to a separate budget.

ll bounty payouts are handled by Sky Governance. Upon confirmation, bug bounty payouts should be included in the next possible Executive Vote. 
This would involve sending USDS directly from the protocol’s buffer to the whitehat hacker.

Immunefi will publicly contact one of the Governance Facilitators with the request, including a specification of the respective vulnerability report, the requested amount and the Ethereum mainnet addresses of the beneficiaries. This should also include the payment details of the Immunefi fee, if it applies. Immunefi and the Sky Governance Facilitators should make sure the payout is made within one full calendar month after the report was approved.

For Bug Bounty rewards over USD 1,000,000: after the first million is paid out, the remaining amount is paid out over time with up to USD 1,000,000 per consecutive month until the determined amount for payout is reached.

However, should additional Stability Scope Advisors be appointed, they will be required to assume full responsibility for all risk management activities associated with Ethena.

As such, the risk framework contains methodologies for calculating the First Loss Capital required with respect to different risk factors. The First Loss Capital requirements for each risk factor relevant to an investment are then added together to arrive at the total First Loss Capital required.

For example, if there are $30 million of DAI borrowings and $70 million of USDC borrowings that are collectively backed by $240 million of WETH and $60 million of WBTC, then 
debt_backed
 for the DAI market and the WETH collateral would be $24 million.

~The Asset Liability Management framework establishes universal rules for Star Agents deploying Sky’s Collateral Portfolio to maintain the stability of the USDS peg through highly liquid assets. The Asset Liability Management framework governs collateral allocation across all Agents, via the Allocation System Primitive, and replaces Sky Core’s historical Asset Liability Management mechanisms which will be offboarded entirely or transitioned to Star Agents.

~~~The “Sky Collateral Portfolio” consists of all assets backing USDS, whether deployed by Star Agents or Sky Core.

In this way, if there is ever downward pressure on the price of USDS these assets can be used to buy USDS to maintain the peg.

~~~To allow the Asset Liability Management obligation of Star Agents to be satisfied in the most efficient way possible, Star Agents may enter into Actively Stabilizing Collateral Rentals between each other, as specified in the Actively Stabilizing Collateral Rental Primitive.

~~~~content:
~~~~A Peg Stability Module (”PSM”) allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for Dai or USDS at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing Dai or USDS. The PSM contract was designed with Stablecoin collateral in mind, allowing users to swap other Stablecoins for Dai or USDS at a fixed rate to aid with keeping Dai or USDS pegged to one (1) USD.

A PSM operates similarly to a regular vault type with a zero Stability Fee and a liquidation ratio of 100% that can only be accessed through a user-facing smart contract containing the relevant swap functions. Unlike regular vaults, users of the PSM do not retain ownership of the asset and borrow Dai or USDS. Instead, PSM users swap the asset directly for Dai or USDS.

~~~A.3.5.3.1 - Introduction - core
~~~content:
~~~Arrangers are Ecosystem Actors who specialize in sourcing, negotiating, structuring, and reporting on Real World Assets, as well as maintaining and monitoring the underlying Arranged Structures used by the Sky Protocol. The Arrangers manage a restricted function on the Arranged Structure Conduit that allows them to send assets onwards to the predetermined blockchain account of the Arranged Structure.

Arrangers are generally prohibited from occupying any position where they could cause damage or loss to the Sky Ecoystem, notwithstanding delays or inconveniences.

After the Arranged Structures are established and assets are allocated, Arrangers must not have the capability to operate or influence the legal and operational structure’s asset operations in any manner that could cause significant harm or losses to the stability of USDS. 

Arrangers are directly approved by SKY voters, and all LRA collateral exposure must be structured by an approved Arranger.

~~~content:
~~~Arrangers must publish monthly reporting on each Arranged Structure they have arranged. 

Every six (6) months, Arrangers are also required to publish a stress test analysis that demonstrates how the structures would perform under historical financial crisis scenarios and other hypothetical scenarios.

The Stability Facilitators must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Stability Facilitators must propose a Governance Poll for warning, temporarily deactivating, or permanently offboarding the Arranger and/or the Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.

To be considered compliant, Arrangers’ monthly reports must satisfy the requirements of one of the following documents:

• Market value of publicly traded equities, ETFs, and mutual funds.

• Market value (the closing price) of publicly traded debt securities. Debt securities that are investment grade and less than 12 months from maturity may alternatively be reported at cost basis + linearly recognizing scheduled interest income.

• A valuation for illiquid or privately traded assets. This should utilize a valuation from a reputable third party with relevant expertise or follow a well-defined methodology that is explained in detail in the report.

• CUSIPs, date of purchase, date of maturity, coupon, cost basis, and face value of all publicly traded debt securities in the portfolio for the last day of the reporting period.

• USDS inflows from the Sky Protocol during the reporting period.

• Total repayments on-chain to the Sky Protocol either to a vault or for surplus. If repayments are derived from multiple sources, they should be broken out into line items for each source.

• Vault debt to the Sky Protocol.

• Copies of original statements for all bank, brokerage, exchange, custodial, or other accounts. The Arranger may redact the names for non-Arranger service providers if and only if that is a requirement of confidentiality agreements with the non-Arranger service providers.

The Stability Facilitator must publicly confirm on the Sky Forum that they have reviewed the original account documentation and verified that it supports the Arranger’s summary.

~~~In case the backstop limit is reached and not overridden, or in case the backstop is halted during the event, the USDS target price receives a haircut to settle the remaining bad debt of the system. This Section must define elements and infrastructure to address this worst-case scenario, including research concerning ways to mitigate damage.

~~~~~content:
~~~~~The Liquidation Ratio parameter limits the maximum amount of Dai debt that a vault user can draw from their vault given the value of their collateral locked in that vault. In practice, it expresses the minimum collateral in percentage terms that can support a given Dai debt. If the ratio of a Vault user's collateral to their debt drops below this value, their vault can be liquidated. Each vault type has its own Liquidation Ratio. The Liquidation Ratio for each vault type is expressed as a percentage value of the collateral that must be present in the vault to support its debt.

Changes to the Liquidation Ratio are subject to the Operational Weekly Cycle, requiring a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote.

~~~~~The Debt Ceiling Limit is numerically provided and acts as an upper limit. The Stability Facilitators can propose changes within this limit. 

Debt Ceiling Limit = Unlimited is defined as large enough to avoid being reached in the near future. 

The DC-IAM methodology contained in 
A.3.8.1.1.2.4 - Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM)
 acts as a risk mitigation tool. It limits the rate at which exposure can increase in a short period of time in the event of an unexpected emergency.

~~~~~A.3.8.1.1.2.3 - Stability Fee - core
~~~~~content:
~~~~~The Stability Fee parameter is an annual percentage fee charged on the Dai generated on Vaults. It is expressed as an annual percentage yield but it is charged on a per-block basis in Dai. The Dai from this fee is minted, added to the Dai debt for the vault, and then transferred into the Surplus Buffer which is under the control of Sky Governance. Each vault type has its own Stability Fee that can be adjusted by the Stability Facilitators. 

The Stability Facilitators must regularly update Vault Types’ Stability Fee according to requirements defined in the subdocuments below. The Stability Scope Advisors must develop a Rate System which can be used to set various interest rates, including the rates for Core Crypto vaults and the minimum lending rate for future Agents. The Rate System must be based on external benchmarks including the risk-free rate and the highest current sustainable rate in crypto financial markets. These rates should act as the lowest and highest base rates to which additional spreads can be added to better reflect the risks involved in specific lending activities.

The Rate System must be dynamic, based on the state of Actively Stabilizing Collateral in the system, and naturally move the state towards the required level of Actively Stabilizing Collateral defined in 
A.3.4 - Asset Liability Management

~~~~~content:
~~~~~The DC-IAM allows any user to adjust the Debt Ceiling of a supported vault type according to the rules defined in the DC-IAM smart contract logic and parameters set by the Stability Facilitators. The DC-IAM holds three parameters that can be set by Sky Governance for each vault type, (i) Maximum Debt Ceiling (
line
), (ii) Target Available Debt (
gap
), and (iii) Ceiling Increase Cooldown (
ttl
).

~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~The 
line
 parameter refers to the maximum value for the Debt Ceiling that the DC-IAM will allow in the given vault type. When using the DC-IAM to manage the Debt Ceiling of a vault type, the 
line
 parameter essentially replaces the Debt Ceiling parameter for that vault type. Rather than Sky Governance setting the Debt Ceiling directly, they will need to set the Maximum Debt Ceiling (
line
) in the DC-IAM. The 
line
 parameter is defined in Dai.

The Maximum Debt Ceiling is defined in 
A.3.8.1.1.2.2 - Debt Ceiling Limit
 and is currently unlimited.

 parameter controls how much of a gap the DC-IAM aims to maintain between the current debt usage and the Debt Ceiling of the vault type. The higher this value, the more risk there is from large collateral drops in very short amounts of time. The smaller this value, the more vault use is negatively affected. The

~~~~~~The Ceiling Increase Cooldown (
ttl
) parameter controls how frequently the Debt Ceiling can be increased by the DC-IAM. If a user attempts to use the DC-IAM to increase the Debt Ceiling of a vault type before this time expires, the transaction will fail to execute and the Debt Ceiling will remain unchanged. The 
ttl
 parameter in combination with the 
gap
 parameter enforces a maximum rate at which debt usage can increase over time using a given vault type. These parameters should be set such that the maximum increase over time can accommodate all reasonable usage of the vault type in question. The 
ttl
 parameter is defined in seconds.

 and 
step
, defined in 
A.3.8.1.1.2.5.1.1 - Auction Price Function (cut)

~~~~~~The

 parameter is a multiplier that is applied to the starting price of a collateral auction. Each vault type has its own Auction Price Multiplier that can be adjusted by Sky Governance separately. This multiplier is intended to be greater than 1.0x because Liquidations 2.0 uses falling price auctions. This means that it is generally preferable for the auction price to begin above the market price and then fall to the correct value over some amount of time. The

~~~~A.3.8.1.3.1 - Legacy Context - core
~~~~content:
~~~~Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. 

There have been several instances where users entered official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically comfortable collateralization ratios (
https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836
). This is, understandably, a poor user experience. 

Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially taxable events. 

This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

~~~~~Specific Goals:

1. Codify a series of good-faith communication efforts.

2. Provide an easy-to-follow process for Sky contributors to follow without significant burden.

3. Minimize the number of users unaware of a collateral offboarding.

4. Provide a method to bypass these requirements in the event a collateral is being offboarded due to serious security or solvency concerns.

1. The author of the collateral offboarding notice shall post to the Sky Forum detailing the recommended offboarding. This forum thread is used to inform downstream announcements on other channels.

2. The Communication Coordinator publishes the associated notices to:

• All public Sky Calendars

• The Sky Official Discord’s Announcement channel.

• The official Sky subreddit.

3. Partner Relationship Leads from relevant Ecosystem Actors reach out to:

• Affected collateral partners (e.g., Aave)

• Affected frontend service providers (e.g., Oasis, DeFi Saver)

Additionally, outreach may be done to cover more channels not listed here. These may include other Ecosystem Actor or Facilitator owned Twitter accounts, communication channels, and platforms.

Unless otherwise noted in

~~A.4.4.2 - Sealing - section
~~content:
~~Sealing is available both for SKY and MKR holders, with 1 MKR counting as 24,000 SKY. Sealing seals the principal tokens behind an Exit Fee. Sealing provides USDS Rewards or Agent Token Rewards.

Sealing users can also generate USDS using the USDS content of the Smart Burn Engine as collateral. Users' ability to generate USDS is based on the equivalent quantity they hold of sealed SKY. The Sealing mechanism is governed by the Stability Scope.

~A.4.5 - Distribution Of Agent Tokens - article
~content:
~To the extent Sky invests capital in Agents and receives tokens in exchange, it will distribute those tokens to the following stakeholders:

• USDS Token Rewards users
• SKY Activation users (see 
A.0.1.1.33 - Activation
)
• SKY Seal users (see 
A.0.1.1.32 - Sealing
)

The percentage of each token distributed to each of these stakeholders is determined by Sky Governance. In each case, to earn rewards users must opt to earn the token of a specific Agent, as opposed to either (1) the token of any other Agent, (2) the Sky Savings Rate in the case of USDS users, or (3) USDS Rewards in the case of SKY Activation or SKY Seal users.

~~~A.5.1.1.3 - Recentering Maker Brand Polls - core
~~~content:
~~~The Accessibility Facilitator must run a one-off special governance poll to determine the long-term brand of the backend protocol, with 3 poll options. The poll must run from November 4 to November 7. The winning option will modify the state of the Atlas as described below. The modifications and provisions of this Atlas Document overrides and supersedes all other Documents in the Atlas, despite conflict in names, tokenomics or anything else.

The 3 poll options are as follows:

Option 1:

Keep the Sky brand as the backend protocol brand. If this option is chosen, no further changes happen and everything remains as today with the brand. The effort to transition MKR to SKY continues, and the Sky brand remains the core brand that both denotes the frontend Sky.money, and the backend Sky Ecosystem and Sky Protocol.

Option 2:

Recenter the Maker brand. If this option is chosen, Sky is kept as the brand for the Sky.money frontend, USDS is also kept as the brand for the new stablecoin - but the underlying backend protocol has its name changed to Maker, and MKR becomes the core asset of the protocol. SkyLink becomes MakerLink, SkyChain becomes MakerChain, Sky Token Rewards becomes Star Token Rewards, and Sky Savings Rate becomes USDS Savings Rate. The Maker brand is returned with its old assets, as currently seen on makerdao.com, with minimal change. SKY tokens initially continue to function exactly the same, and SKY Token Rewards would continue at the same rate. Once SPK launches, SKY Token Rewards would be turned off, and the ability to migrate from MKR to SKY would be turned off. However, SKY to MKR migration would remain permanently, with a technical modification to ensure that SKY is backed by a finite amount of MKR, rather than the ability to emit new MKR. The ratio of SKY to MKR will permanently remain 1:24,000. The governance forum would revert to forum.makerdao.com and other similar assets would also revert to Maker branding - with the exception of the main @skyecosystem X handle. What happens to the X handle would be decided in a later process when it is determined what’s going to happen with Sky.

Option 3:

Recenter the Maker brand, with a limited brand refresh. If this option is chosen, Sky is kept as the brand for the Sky.money frontend, USDS is also kept as the brand for the new stablecoin - but the underlying backend protocol has its name changed to Maker, and MKR becomes the core asset of the protocol. SkyLink becomes MakerLink, SkyChain becomes MakerChain, Sky Token Rewards becomes Star Token Rewards, and Sky Savings Rate becomes USDS Savings Rate. The Maker brand is slightly modified to better align with the USDS brand identity, and to align with its role as the maker of the StarDAOs. The logo font can be slightly refreshed and polished, and the colour scheme and general aesthetic should be inspired by the dark blue / navy “star theme” that can be seen on Sky.money in sections that describe Stars and governance. SKY tokens initially continue to function exactly the same, and SKY Token Rewards would continue at the same rate. Once SPK launches, SKY Token Rewards would be turned off, and the ability to migrate from MKR to SKY would be turned off. However, SKY to MKR migration would remain permanently, with a technical modification to ensure that SKY is backed by a finite amount of MKR, rather than the ability to emit new MKR. The ratio of SKY to MKR will permanently remain 1:24,000. The governance forum would revert to forum.makerdao.com and other similar assets would also revert to Maker branding - with the exception of the main @skyecosystem X handle. What happens to the X handle would be decided in a later process when it is determined what’s going to happen with Sky.

The Accessibility Facilitator may gather feedback and input to these 3 options during the week of voting on this Atlas Edit, and use that to modify the exact language of the 3 poll options before they are put out in their final state. Any edits made in this way to a poll option will become binding on the Atlas, if the poll ends up winning.

The option that gets a plurality becomes the final outcome effective immediately from the moment the poll ends.

If Option 1 has a plurality when counting individually, but Option 2 + Option 3 combined has a plurality, then the outcome is Option 2.

The Accessibility Facilitator must prepare for all 3 options being chosen, including preparing brand assets in advance. If recentering the Maker Brand is chosen, in either form, then this must be implemented at events and other accessibility campaigns from the moment the poll ends, to the extent this is reasonably possible.

Long term implications for SKY

If recentering the Maker brand is chosen (Option 2 or Option 3), then, depending on what outcome is chosen for the Sky brand, the current SKY token may be renamed (e.g. to OLD_SKY), and a new SKY token can be created and used for a different purpose, such as a StarDAO. In any case, holders of the current SKY token would be guaranteed the ability to migrate back to MKR for an unlimited amount of time, and holders would be able to hold their original SKY tokens forever if they desire.

USDS core Stablecoin and DAI ERC20 Wrapper

The core stablecoin and product of the protocol is called USDS. It has multiple ERC20 wrappers, including the ERC20 USDS wrapper, and the ERC20 DAI Wrapper and ERC20 sDAI Wrapper. The total supply of USDS is the total supply of internal stablecoins in the protocol that backs all wrappers. The total supply of Dai can also be calculated by summing the supply of all wrappers branded as Dai, including Dai, sDai and Chai.

~~~~content:
~~~~Spark is an Agent focused on building on USDS in the Ethereum and adjacent DeFi ecosystem. This includes driving adoption of USDS and deploying collateral backing USDS at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Spark does this through the Spark Liquidity Layer, SparkLend, and Spark Savings.


- 
The Spark Liquidity Layer directly provides USDS, sUSDS, and USDC liquidity across networks and DeFi markets.


- 
SparkLend is a lending market focused on USDS borrowing, sourcing liquidity directly from Sky to provide the best borrow rates for USDS.


- 
Spark Savings enables stablecoin holders to earn the best risk-adjusted rate in DeFi, at large scale, with minimal liquidity constraints.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.1.2.3.1.2.2.5.2 - Swap USDC to USDS - core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~This document defines a series of operations to 
swap
 USDC to USDS through the PSM.
    
◦ Ensure you’re working as a 
Relayer
. Only the 
RELAYER
 role is allowed to 
swapUSDCToUSDS
. Also, ensure the contract 
isActive
 i.e. can process the request.
  
function swapUSDCToUSDS(uint256 usdcAmount)
        external 
        onlyRole(RELAYER) 
        isActive

    
◦ Ensure the 
RateLimits
 allow to 
swap
 the required USDC amount to USDS.

cancelRateLimit(LIMIT_USDS_TO_USDC, usdcAmount)

    
◦ Ensure ALM Proxy has enough USDC balance to 
swap
 for the required USDS amount.
    
◦ Approve the PSM to spend USDC. 
The approval is needed for the PSM to be able to execute a 
swap
 of USDC.

proxy.doCall(
    address(usdc),
    abi.encodeCall(usdc.approve, (address(psm), usdcAmount))
);

    
◦ Calculate the 
swap
 
limit
 per transaction. 
The maximum amount of USDC that can be swapped to DAI in one transaction is calculated, based on the DAI balance held by the PSM.

psmTo18ConversionFactor
 converts DAI’s 18 token decimals to USDC’s 6 token decimals.

uint256 limit = dai.balanceOf(address(psm)) / psmTo18ConversionFactor;

    
◦ Perform a 
direct swap
 feasibility check and 
swap
 USDC to DAI, if possible. 
If the 
usdcAmount
 is less than or equal to the 
limit
, a direct swap is performed. 
_swapUSDCToDAI
 is called to execute the swap from 
USDC
 to 
DAI
.

if (usdcAmount <= limit) {
    _swapUSDCToDAI(usdcAmount);
}

    
◦ If 
direct swap
 is not possible, perform 
iterative swap
 of USDC to DAI with DAI 
refilling
. 
If the 
usdcAmount
 exceeds the limit, the contract splits the swap into multiple smaller swaps as follows:
        1. Refill the PSM with DAI by calling 
psm.fill()
.
        2. Recalculate the limit to see how much USDC can be swapped after the refill.
        3. Swap the maximum possible USDC amount that doesn't exceed the limit.
        4. Update 
remainingUsdcToSwap
 by subtracting the amount just swapped.
        5. Repeat the process until the full 
usdcAmount
 is swapped. 

If the PSM can't be filled, the transaction reverts with 
DssLitePsm/nothing-to-fill
.

else {
    uint256 remainingUsdcToSwap = usdcAmount;

    while (remainingUsdcToSwap > 0) {
        psm.fill();

        limit = dai.balanceOf(address(psm)) / psmTo18ConversionFactor;

        uint256 swapAmount = remainingUsdcToSwap < limit ? remainingUsdcToSwap : limit;

        _swapUSDCToDAI(swapAmount);

        remainingUsdcToSwap -= swapAmount;
    }
}

    
◦ Convert USDC amount to DAI amount accounting for the token decimal difference.
  
{
        uint256 daiAmount = usdcAmount * psmTo18ConversionFactor;

    
◦ Approve the 
daiUsds
 contract to spend the 
daiAmount
 on behalf of the 
proxy
.
  
proxy.doCall(
    address(dai),
    abi.encodeCall(dai.approve, (address(daiUsds), daiAmount))
);

    
◦ Swap DAI to USDS. 
DAI is swapped to USDS in a 1:1 ratio through the 
daiUsds
 contract and sent back to the 
proxy
.

proxy.doCall(
            address(daiUsds),
            abi.encodeCall(daiUsds.daiToUsds, (address(proxy), daiAmount))
        );

~~~~~~~~~~~~~This document defines the process to bridge USDC using the Circle Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol.
    
◦ Ensure you’re working as a 
Relayer
. Only the 
RELAYER
 role is allowed to 
transferUSDCToCCTP
. Also, ensure the contract 
isActive
 i.e. can process the request.

function transferUSDCToCCTP(uint256 usdcAmount, uint32 destinationDomain)
        external
        onlyRole(RELAYER)
        isActive

    
◦ Ensure the bridging transaction complies with 
RateLimits
. 

LIMIT_USDC_TO_CCTP
: Enforces a rate limit on total USDC transferred via CCTP. 

LIMIT_USDC_TO_DOMAIN
: Enforces a rate limit on USDC transferred to a specific 
destinationDomain
.

rateLimited(LIMIT_USDC_TO_CCTP, usdcAmount)
        rateLimited(
            RateLimitHelpers.makeDomainKey(LIMIT_USDC_TO_DOMAIN, destinationDomain),
            usdcAmount
        )

    
◦ Verify 
mint
 recipient. 
Check that a mint recipient (mapping from domain IDs to recipient addresses) is configured for the 
destinationDomain
. 
If no recipient is configured, the transaction reverts with an error message.

bytes32 mintRecipient = mintRecipients[destinationDomain];
require(mintRecipient != 0, "MainnetController/domain-not-configured");

    
◦ Ensure ALM Proxy has enough USDC to cover the amount instructed in the transfer.
    
◦ Approve CCTP to spend USDC on behalf of the 
proxy
. 
This action is necessary for the CCTP contract to initiate the cross-chain transfer.

proxy.doCall(
    address(usdc),
    abi.encodeCall(usdc.approve, (address(cctp), usdcAmount))
);


    
◦ Initiate the USDC transfer through CCTP.
        ◦ Check the 
transfer limit
.
           Retrieve the maximum amount of USDC that can be transferred in a single CCTP message. This limit is fetched from the 
localMinter
 contract associated with CCTP.
           
uint256 burnLimit = cctp.localMinter().burnLimitsPerMessage(address(usdc));


        ◦ If single transaction is possible within per-message limit, initiate the CCTP transfer for the entire USDC amount.
          
 {
    _initiateCCTPTransfer(usdcAmount, destinationDomain, mintRecipient);
}


        ◦ If 
usdcAmount
 exceeds the per-message limit, the transfer is split into multiple smaller batches executing the following loop until the remaining amount is less than or equal to the limit.
            1. Transfer the maximum allowed (
burnLimit
) using 
_initiateCCTPTransfer
.
            2. Reduce the remaining 
usdcAmount
 by the 
burnLimit
.
             
while (usdcAmount > burnLimit) {
    _initiateCCTPTransfer(burnLimit, destinationDomain, mintRecipient);
    usdcAmount -= burnLimit;
}


        ◦ Send remaining USDC amount (if applicable)
           If there is any 
usdcAmount
 left after the loop, send the remaining amount in a single transfer, ensuring the entire amount is transferred, even if it didn't divide evenly by the 
burnLimit
.
          
if (usdcAmount > 0) {
    _initiateCCTPTransfer(usdcAmount, destinationDomain, mintRecipient);
}

 that will be received in return for depositing the asset.

rateLimitedAsset(LIMIT_PSM_DEPOSIT, asset, amount)
        returns (uint256 shares)

    
◦ Via 
proxy.doCall
 approve the transfer of 
amount
 of the specified 
asset
 to the PSM contract through the 
IERC20.approve.
 
The 
approve
 function of the ERC-20 token allows the PSM contract to spend the 
amount
 of the 
asset
 that is being deposited.

proxy.doCall(
    asset,
    abi.encodeCall(IERC20.approve, (address(psm), amount))
);


    
◦ Deposit the 
asset
 into the PSM via the 
deposit
 function of the PSM contract.
        ◦ Encode the function using 
abi.encodeCall
, creating the necessary data for the call:
            • 
asset
: The address of the ERC-20 token being deposited.
            • 
address(proxy)
: The address of the proxy contract that is making the deposit on behalf of the user.
            • 
amount
: The amount of the asset to deposit into the PSM.

        ◦ Use the proxy contract to call the

~~~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.1.2.3.3.1 - Freeze Contract Functionalities - core
~~~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~~~This document defines the emergency procedure to temporarily disable functions within the Controller contract.
    
◦ Temporarily disable contract functionalities.
    The 
freeze
 function is an emergency procedure to be used to protect against risks such as security vulnerabilities, market volatility, or governance decisions.

        ◦ Ensure you’re working as a Freezer. Only the 
FREEZER_ROLE
 is allowed to 
freeze
 the contract.
         
function freeze() 
external 
onlyRole(FREEZER)


        ◦ Pause the contract functions by setting the state variable 
active
 to 
false
.
         
active = false;

          This variable is typically checked in the 
isActive
 modifier:
          
modifier isActive {
    require(active, "MainnetController/not-active");
    _;
}

          This effectively pauses any functions using the 
isActive
 modifier.

        ◦ Emit the event for off-chain tracking.
          
emit Frozen();


◦ Reactivate disabled contract functionalities.
        ◦ Ensure you’re working as an Admin. Only the 
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
 is allowed to 
reactivate
 the contract.

 function reactivate() 
           external 
           onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)


        ◦ Resume normal contract operations by setting the state variable 
active
 back to 
true
.
          
active = true;

           This allows functions using the 
isActive
 modifier to be called again.

        ◦ Emit the event for off-chain tracking.
         
emit Reactivated();

The signers should consult with Ecosystem Actor DAOcraft before exercising such authority, unless such consultation would cause a delay that could result in a loss of user funds or harm to Sky or Spark. Ecosystem Actor DAOcraft may also ask the signers to exercise the Freezer Multisig in an emergency. The signers will work with DAOcraft and, if necessary, other Ecosystem Actors, in good faith in determining whether to exercise their authority based on such request. 

Each action executed by the Freezer Multisig, including any function calls and their parameters, must be reported to the Sky community within a reasonable time frame through a post on the Sky Forum.

~~~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~~~Modification of the signers of the Freezer Multisig must be approved through a Governance Poll; no Executive Vote is required. 

The only exceptions to this are if: 1) a signer self-reports a loss of access to their private key due to any reason; or 2) a signer explicitly expresses their wish to be removed as a signer. In both cases, the signer is required to communicate the loss of access to their private key, or the wish to be removed as a signer, in the form of a public Sky Forum post. The specific signer should be replaced as soon as possible.

Any changes to the Multisig signers that do not fall within the two exceptions listed above, or that have not been ratified by Sky Governance, should be questioned immediately and treated as malicious. Where malicious activity is suspected, the Governance Facilitators must prepare an expedited Executive Vote so that Sky Governance can vote on removing external security access from the Multisig.

~~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.2.1.1.3 - Interest Rate Model Definition - core
~~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~~The Interest Rate Model (”IRM”) is defined by four main parameters:

1. Base Rate - the starting rate at 0% utilization

2. Variable Slope 1 - the rate at optimal utilization

3. Variable Slope 2 - the rate at 100% utilization

4. Utilization - the utilization itself

The Base Rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2 parameters are further defined in: 
A.AG1.3.2.2.1.1.13 - Base Rate Definition
; 
A.AG1.3.2.2.1.1.15 - Slope 1 Definition
; and 
A.AG1.3.2.2.1.1.17 - Slope 2 Definition
. 

All markets except Dai use this IRM. The IRM for Dai is independent of utilization and is defined as a spread over the Core Stability Parameters Base Rate set forth in 
A.3.2.2.1 - Base Rate
. The spread is determined by the Stability Facilitators, in consultation with the Stability Scope Advisors.

~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.2.1.3 - SparkLend Risk Parameters Cap Automators - core
~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~Cap Automators allow the Supply Cap defined in 
A.AG1.3.2.2.1.1.9 - Supply Cap Definition
 and the Borrow Cap defined in 
A.AG1.3.2.2.1.1.10 - Borrow Cap Definition
 to be dynamically adjusted. 

The Cap Automater is defined in terms of three parameters:

1. 
gap
 - the target available exposure

2. 
ttl
 - the cooldown period for cap increases

3. 
max
 - the absolute maximum exposure

Any user can permissionlessly update a covered Supply Cap or Borrow Cap so the available exposure is equal to the target, as long as the resulting exposure does not exceed the specified maximum limit and the cooldown period has elapsed in the case of increases to the Supply Cap or Borrow Cap.

~~~~~~~~The kill switch disables all borrowing across SparkLend markets in the event of a depeg on key collateral assets. 

The kill switch is defined in terms of a threshold for specified pegged assets. If the ratio of the price of a specified asset to its peg is equal to or less than the threshold, then any user can trigger the kill switch to disable borrowing across all SparkLend markets.

After the kill switch is triggered, markets can be reactivated by Sky Governance after resetting the kill switch. Resetting the kill switch is subject to the Governance Security Delay specified in

~~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.2.2.3.1 - Sky Core Governance Responsibility For Virtual Revenue Share Prior to Launch of SPK - core
~~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~~Before the launch of Agent tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a “virtual revenue share” on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a “virtual income” equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. 

As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. 

This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol. 

Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect. See 
A.AG1.3.2.2.2.3.2 - Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch
.

~~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.2.2.3.2 - Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch - core
~~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~~Post SPK launch, the following revenue-share operational process takes effect. The revenue share payment must be calculated manually at the end of each quarter by the Spark and manually paid as Dai to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance from Spark. The payments must occur for the revenue share duration of two (2) years, starting from September 25th, 2023. 

If at any point in time after the launch of Agent tokens, Spark Protocol is generating less than 1 million Dai per year in income for Spark Agent, accrual towards the revenue share payments are paused (unpaid revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when Spark Protocol is generating more than 1 million Dai per year in income again.

~~~~~~~~A.AG1.3.2.4.1.1 - Conditions For The Pre-launch Token Rewards - core
~~~~~~~~content:
~~~~~~~~Spark has a pre-launch token rewards program based on the usage of its lending platform. Users of the platform will receive an airdrop of SPK tokens, depending on how much and how long they have used the platform during the pre-launch token reward period. These rewards are only for users on Ethereum Mainnet. 

There are two seasons of the Spark pre-launch token rewards: Season 1 and Season 2. 

Season 1 of pre-launch token rewards was active from August 20 2023 and lasted for nine months, ending on May 20 2024. 
130,434,783
 SPK tokens were allocated in this period. 

In Season 2 
14,478,261
 SPK will be rewarded per month to SparkLend users who qualify for the airdrop. 

Season 2 is an additional pre-farming period, which runs until the Spark Agent launches as part of Sky Endgame launch season. 

The monthly SPK rewards are allocated as follows:
◦ 80 % is allocated to users borrowing DAI and/or USDS
◦ 20 % is allocated to users supplying ETH

The proposed full anti-cheat SPK Airdrop for SparkLend is calculated using the following formula:


Airdrop = 80% * (DAI Borrows + USDS Borrows - sDAI Supplies * sDAI Liquidation Threshold - sUSDS Supplies * sUSDS Liquidation Threshold) + 20% * (ETH Supplies - ETH Borrows / ETH Liquidation Threshold)


All supplies and borrows are denominated in USD based on the on-chain oracle price at that block to determine the conversion.
